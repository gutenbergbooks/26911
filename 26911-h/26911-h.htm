<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>FOLLOWING A CROOKED TRAIL</h3>
</div>

<p>Across Dry Valley a dust cloud had been
moving for hours. It rolled into Saguache
at the brisk heels of a bunch of horses just
about the time the town was settling itself to supper.
At the intersection of Main and La Junta
streets the cloud was churned to a greater volume
and density. From out of the heart of it cantered
a rider, who swung his pony as on a half dollar,
and deflected the remuda toward Chunn&#8217;s corral.</p>
<p>The rider was in the broad-rimmed felt hat, the
gray shirt, the plain leather chaps of a vaquero.
The alkali dust of Arizona lay thick on every exposed
inch of him, but youth bloomed inextinguishably
through the grime. As he swept forward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
with a whoop to turn the lead horses it rang in his
voice, announced itself in his carriage, was apparent
in the modeling of his slim, hard body. Under
other conditions he might have been a college freshman
for age, but the competent confidence of manhood
sat easily on his broad shoulders. He was already
a graduate of that school of experience which
always holds open session on the baked desert.
Curly Flandrau had more than once looked into the
chill eyes of death.</p>
<p>The leaders of the herd dribbled into the corral
through the open gate, and the others crowded on
their heels. Three more riders followed Curly into
the enclosure. Upon them, too, the desert had
sifted its white coat. The stained withers of the
animals they rode told of long, steady travel. One
of them, a red-haired young fellow of about the
same age as Curly, swung stiffly from the saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me for a square meal first off,&#8221; he gave out
promptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not till we&#8217;ve finished this business, Mac. We&#8217;ll
put a deal right through if Warren&#8217;s here,&#8221; decided
a third member of the party. He was a tough-looking
customer of nearly fifty. From out of his
leathery sun-and-wind beaten face, hard eyes
looked without expression. &#8220;Bad Bill&#8221; Cranston
he was called, and the man looked as if he had
earned his sobriquet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And what if he ain&#8217;t here?&#8221; snarled the fourth.
&#8220;Are you aiming to sit down and wait for him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll cross that bridge when we come to it,&#8221;
Bad Bill answered. &#8220;Curly, want to ride up to the
hotel and ask if Mr. Dave Warren is there? Bring
him right down if he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And say, young fellow, don&#8217;t shout all over the
place what your business is with him,&#8221; ordered the
previous speaker sulkily. Lute Blackwell, a squat
heavily muscled man of forty, had the manner of
a bully. Unless his shifty eyes lied he was both
cruel and vindictive.</p>
<p>Curly&#8217;s gaze traveled over him leisurely. Not a
muscle in the boyish face moved, but in the voice
one might have guessed an amused contempt. &#8220;All
right. I won&#8217;t, since you mention it, Lute.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young man cantered up the dusty street
toward the hotel. Blackwell trailed toward the
windmill pump.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought you&#8217;d fixed it with this Warren to be
right on the spot so&#8217;s we could unload on him
prompt,&#8221; he grumbled at Cranston without looking
toward the latter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t promise he&#8217;d be hanging round your
neck soon as you hit town,&#8221; Cranston retorted
coolly. &#8220;Keep your shirt on, Lute. No use getting
in a sweat.&#8221;</p>
<p>The owner of the corral sauntered from the stable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
and glanced over the bunch of horses milling
around.</p>
<p>&#8220;Been traveling some,&#8221; he suggested to Bad Bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;A few. Seen anything of a man named Warren
about town to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been down here se-ve-re-al times. Said
he was looking for a party with stock to sell.
Might you be the outfit he&#8217;s expecting?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We might.&#8221; Bad Bill took the drinking cup
from Blackwell and drained it. &#8220;I reckon the dust
was caked in my throat an inch deep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Drive all the way from the Bar Double M?&#8221;
asked the keeper of the corral, his eyes on the
brand stamped on the flank of a pony circling past.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bad Bill turned away and began to unsaddle. He
did not intend to volunteer any information, though
on the other hand he did not want to stir suspicion
by making a mystery for gossips to chew on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like you been hitting the road at a right
lively gait.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mac cut in. &#8220;Shoulder of my bronc&#8217;s chafed
from the saddle. Got anything that&#8217;ll heal it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet I have.&#8221; The man hurried into the
stable and the redheaded cowpuncher winked across
the back of his horse at Bill.</p>
<p>The keeper of the stable and the young man were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
still busy doctoring the sore when Curly arrived
with Warren. The buyer was a roundbodied man
with black gimlet eyes that saw much he never told.
The bargain he drove was a hard one, but it did
not take long to come to terms at about one-third
the value of the string he was purchasing. Very
likely he had his suspicions, but he did not voice
them. No doubt they cut a figure in the price.
He let it be understood that he was a supply agent
for the rebels in Mexico. Before the bills were
warm in the pockets of the sellers, his vaqueros
were mounted and were moving the remuda toward
the border.</p>
<p>Curly and Mac helped them get started. As they
rode back to the corral a young man came out
from the stable. Flandrau forgot that there were
reasons why he wanted just now to be a stranger
in the land with his identity not advertised. He let
out a shout.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh you, Slats Davis!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Curly! How are things a-comin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine. When did you blow in to Saguache?
Ain&#8217;t you off your run some?&#8221;</p>
<p>They had ridden the range together and had
frolicked around on a dozen boyish larks. Their
ways had suited each other and they had been a
good deal more than casual bunkies. To put it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
mildly the meeting was likely to prove embarrassing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Came down to see about getting some cows
for the old man from the Fiddleback outfit,&#8221; Davis
explained. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t expect to bump into friends
&#8217;way down here. You riding for the Bar Double
M?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a momentary silence. Curly&#8217;s vigilant
eyes met those of his old side partner. What did
Slats know? Had he been in the stable while the
remuda was still in the corral? Had he seen them
with Bad Bill and Blackwell? Were his suspicions
already active?</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m riding for the Map of Texas,&#8221; Flandrau
answered evenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Curly. Let&#8217;s go feed our faces,&#8221; Mac
called from the stable.</p>
<p>Flandrau nodded. &#8220;You still with the Hashknife?&#8221;
he asked Davis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Still with &#8217;em. I&#8217;ve been raised to assistant
foreman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bully for you. That&#8217;s great. All right, Mac.
I&#8217;m coming. That&#8217;s sure great, old hoss. Well,
see you later, Slats.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flandrau followed Mac, dissatisfied with himself
for leaving his friend so cavalierly. In the old days
they had told each other everything, had talked
things out together before many a campfire. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
guessed Slats would be hurt, but he had to think
of his partners in this enterprise.</p>
<p>After supper they took a room at the hotel and
divided the money Warren had paid for the horses.
None of them had slept for the last fifty hours and
Mac proposed to tumble into bed at once.</p>
<p>Bad Bill shook his head. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t, Mac.
Let&#8217;s hit the trail and do our sleeping in the hills.
There&#8217;s too many telephone lines into this town to
suit me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sho! We made a clean getaway, and we&#8217;re
plumb wore out. Our play isn&#8217;t to hike out like
we were scared stiff of something. What we want
to do is to act as if we could look every darned
citizen in the face. Mac&#8217;s sure right,&#8221; Curly
agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You kids make me tired. As if you knew anything
about it. I&#8217;m going to dust <i>muy pronto</i>,&#8221;
Blackwell snarled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. Whenever you like. You go and we&#8217;ll
stay. Then everybody&#8217;ll be satisfied. We got to
split up anyhow,&#8221; Mac said.</p>
<p>Bad Bill looked at Blackwell and nodded. &#8220;That&#8217;s
right. We don&#8217;t all want to pull a blue streak.
That would be a dead give away. Let the kids
stay if they want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So as they can round on us if they&#8217;re nabbed,&#8221;
Blackwell sneered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>Cranston called him down roughly. &#8220;That&#8217;ll be
enough along that line, Lute. I don&#8217;t stand for
any more cracks like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blackwell, not three months out from the penitentiary,
faced the other with an ugly look in his
eyes. He was always ready to quarrel, but he did
not like to fight unless he had a sure thing. He
knew Bad Bill was an ugly customer when he once
got started.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t mean any harm,&#8221; the ex-convict growled.
&#8220;But I don&#8217;t like this sticking around town. I tell
you straight I don&#8217;t like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I wouldn&#8217;t stay if I were you,&#8221; Curly
suggested promptly. &#8220;Mac and I have got a different
notion. So we&#8217;ll tie to Saguache for a day or
two.&#8221;</p>
<p>As soon as the older men had gone the others
tumbled into bed and fell asleep at once. Daylight
was sifting in through the open window before their
eyes opened. Somebody was pounding on the bedroom
door, which probably accounted for Flandrau&#8217;s
dream that a sheriff was driving nails in the
lid of a coffin containing one Curly.</p>
<p>Mac was already out of bed when his partner&#8217;s
feet hit the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up, Mac?&#8221;</p>
<p>The eyes of the redheaded puncher gleamed with
excitement. His six-gun was in his hand. By the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
look of him he was about ready to whang loose
through the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold your horses, you chump,&#8221; Curly sang out
&#8220;It&#8217;s the hotel clerk. I left a call with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it was not the hotel clerk after all. Through
the door came a quick, jerky voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;That you, Curly? For God&#8217;s sake, let me in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before he had got the words out the door was
open. Slats came in and shut it behind him. He
looked at Mac, the forty-five shaking in the boy&#8217;s
hand, and he looked at Flandrau.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re after you,&#8221; he said, breathing fast as
if he had been running.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; fired Curly back at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Bar Double M boys. They just reached
town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Put up that gun, Mac, and move into your
clothes immediate,&#8221; ordered Curly. Then to Davis:
&#8220;Go on. Unload the rest. What do they know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They inquired for you and your friend here
down at the Legal Tender. The other members of
your party they could only guess at.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have we got a chance to make our getaway?&#8221;
Mac asked.</p>
<p>Davis nodded. &#8220;Slide out through the kitchen,
cut into the alley, and across lots to the corral.
We&#8217;ll lock the door and I&#8217;ll hold them here long
as I can.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Good boy, Slats. If there&#8217;s a necktie party
you&#8217;ll get the first bid,&#8221; Curly grinned.</p>
<p>Slats looked at him, cold and steady. Plainer
than words he was telling his former friend that
he would not joke with a horse thief. For the sake
of old times he would save him if he could, but he
would call any bluffs about the whole thing being a
lark.</p>
<p>Curly&#8217;s eyes fell away. It came to him for the
first time that he was no longer an honest man.
Up till this escapade he had been only wild, but now
he had crossed the line that separates decent folks
from outlaws. He had been excited with liquor
when he joined in this fool enterprise, but that
made no difference now. He was a rustler, a horse
thief. If he lived a hundred years he could never
get away from the disgrace of it.</p>
<p>Not another word was said while they hurried
into their clothes. But as Curly passed out of the
door he called back huskily. &#8220;Won&#8217;t forget what
you done for us, Slats.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again their eyes met. Davis did not speak, but
the chill look on his face told Flandrau that he
had lost a friend.</p>
<p>The two young men ran down the back stairs,
passed through the kitchen where a Chinese cook
was getting breakfast, and out into the bright sunlight.
Before they cut across to the corral their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
eyes searched for enemies. Nobody was in sight
except the negro janitor of a saloon busy putting
empty bottles into a barrel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t do to be in any hurry. The play is we&#8217;re
gentlemen of leisure, just out for an amble to get
the mo&#8217;ning air,&#8221; Curly cautioned.</p>
<p>While they fed, watered, and saddled they
swapped gossip with the wrangler. It would not
do to leave the boy with a story of two riders in
such a hurry to hit the trail that they could not wait
to feed their bronchos. So they stuck it out while
the animals ate, though they were about as contented
as a two-pound rainbow trout on a hook.
One of them was at the door all the time to make
sure the way was still clear. At that they shaved
it fine, for as they rode away two men were coming
down the street.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kite Bonfils,&#8221; Curly called to his partner.</p>
<p>No explanation was needed. Bonfils was the
foreman of the Bar Double M. He let out a shout
as he caught sight of them and began to run forward.
Simultaneously his gun seemed to jump from
its holster.</p>
<p>Mac&#8217;s quirt sang and his pony leaped to a canter
in two strides. A bullet zipped between them. Another
struck the dust at their heels. Faintly there
came to the fugitives the sound of the foreman&#8217;s
impotent curses. They had escaped for the time.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>Presently they passed the last barb wire fence and
open country lay before them. It did not greatly
matter which direction they followed, so long as
they headed into the desert.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re looking for is a country filled with
absentees,&#8221; Curly explained with a grin.</p>
<p>Neither of them had ever been in serious trouble
before and both regretted the folly that had turned
their drunken spree into a crime. Once or twice
they came to the edge of a quarrel, for Mac was
ready to lay the blame on his companion. Moreover,
he had reasons why the thing he had done
loomed up as a heinous offense.</p>
<p>His reasons came out before the camp fire on
Dry Sandy that evening. They were stretched in
front of it trying to make a smoke serve instead
of supper. Mac broke a gloomy silence to grunt
out jerkily a situation he could no longer keep to
himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s where I get my walking papers I reckon.
No rustlers need apply.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly shot a slant glance at him. &#8220;Meaning&mdash;the
girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>The redheaded puncher nodded. &#8220;She&#8217;ll throw
me down sure. Why shouldn&#8217;t she? I tell you
I&#8217;ve ruined my life. You&#8217;re only a kid. What you
know about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>He took from his coat pocket a photograph and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
showed it to his friend. The sweet clean face of
a wholesome girl smiled at Curly.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s ce&#8217;tainly a right nice young lady. I&#8217;ll bet
she stands by you all right. Where&#8217;s she live
at?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Waits in a restaurant at Tombstone. We was
going to be married soon as we had saved five
hundred dollars.&#8221; Mac swallowed hard. &#8220;And I
had to figure out this short cut to the money whilst
I was drunk. As if she&#8217;d look at money made
that way. Why, we&#8217;d a-been ready by Christmas
if I&#8217;d only waited.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly tried to cheer him up, but did not make
much of a job at it. The indisputable facts were
that Mac was an outlaw and a horse thief. Very
likely a price was already on his head.</p>
<p>The redheaded boy rolled another cigarette despondently.
&#8220;Sho! I&#8217;ve cooked my goose. She&#8217;ll
not look at me&mdash;even if they don&#8217;t send me to the
pen.&#8221; In a moment he added huskily, staring into
the deepening darkness: &#8220;And she&#8217;s the best ever.
Her name&#8217;s Myra Anderson.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abruptly Mac got up and disappeared in the
night, muttering something about looking after the
horses. His partner understood well enough what
was the matter. The redheaded puncher was in a
stress of emotion, and like the boy he was he did
not want Curly to know it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>Flandrau pretended to be asleep when Mac returned
half an hour later.</p>
<p>They slept under a live oak with the soundness
of healthy youth. For the time they forgot their
troubles. Neither of them knew that as the hours
slipped away red tragedy was galloping closer to
them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>CAMPING WITH OLD MAN TROUBLE</h3>
</div>

<p>The sun was shining in his face when Curly
wakened. He sat up and rubbed his eyes. Mac
was nowhere in sight. Probably he had gone to
get the horses.</p>
<p>A sound broke the stillness of the desert. It
might have been the explosion of a giant firecracker,
but Flandrau knew it was nothing so harmless.
He leaped to his feet, and at the same instant
Mac came running over the brow of the hill.
A smoking revolver was in his hand.</p>
<p>From behind the hill a gun cracked&mdash;then a
second&mdash;and a third. Mac stumbled over his feet
and pitched forward full length on the ground.
His friend ran toward him, forgetting the revolver
that lay in its holster under the live oak. Every
moment he expected to see Mac jump up, but the
figure stretched beside the cholla never moved.
Flandrau felt the muscles round his heart tighten.
He had seen sudden death before, but never had
it come so near home.</p>
<p>A bullet sent up a spurt of dust in front of him,
another just on the left. Riders were making a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
half circle around the knoll and closing in on him.
In his right mind Curly would have been properly
frightened. But now he thought only of Mac lying
there so still in the sand. Right into the fire zone
he ran, knelt beside his partner, and lifted the red-thatched
head. A little hole showed back of the
left ear and another at the right temple. A bullet
had plowed through the boy&#8217;s skull.</p>
<p>Softly Flandrau put the head back in the sand
and rose to his feet. The revolver of the dead
puncher was in his hand. The attackers had stopped
shooting, but when they saw him rise a rifle puffed
once more. The riders were closing in on him now.
The nearest called to him to surrender. Almost
at the same time a red hot pain shot through the
left arm of the trapped rustler. Someone had
nipped him from the rear.</p>
<p>Curly saw red. Surrender nothing! He would
go down fighting. As fast as he could blaze he
emptied Mac&#8217;s gun. When the smoke cleared the
man who had ordered him to give up was slipping
from his horse. Curly was surprised, but he knew
he must have hit him by chance.</p>
<p>&#8220;We got him. His gun&#8217;s empty,&#8221; someone
shouted.</p>
<p>Cautiously they closed in, keeping him covered
all the time. Of a sudden the plain tilted up to
meet the sky. Flandrau felt himself swaying on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
his feet. Everything went black. The boy had
fainted.</p>
<p>When he came to himself strange faces were all
around him, and there were no bodies to go with
them. They seemed to float about in an odd casual
sort of way. Then things cleared.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s coming to all right,&#8221; one said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good. I&#8217;d hate to have him cheat the rope,&#8221;
another cried with an oath.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. How is Cullison?&#8221;</p>
<p>This was said to another who had just come up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hard hit. Looks about all in. Got him in
the side.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rage had died out of Curly. In a flash he
saw all that had come of their drunken spree: the
rustling of the Bar Double M stock, the discovery,
the death of his friend and maybe of Cullison, the
certain punishment that would follow. He was a
horse thief caught almost in the act. Perhaps he
was a murderer too. And the whole thing had
been entirely unpremeditated.</p>
<p>Flandrau made a movement to rise and they
jerked him to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve played hell,&#8221; one of the men told the
boy.</p>
<p>He was a sawed-off little fellow known as Dutch.
Flandrau had seen him in the Map of Texas country
try a year or two before. The rest were strangers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
to the boy. All of them looked at him out of hard
hostile eyes. He was scarcely a human being to
them; rather a wolf to be stamped out of existence
as soon as it was convenient. A chill ran down
Curly&#8217;s spine. He felt as if someone were walking
on his grave.</p>
<p>At a shift in the group Flandrau&#8217;s eyes fell on
his friend lying in the sand with face turned whitely
to the sky he never would see again. It came over
him strangely enough how Mac used to break into
a little chuckling laugh when he was amused. He
had quit laughing now for good and all. A lump
came into the boy&#8217;s throat and he had to work it
down before he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a picture in his pocket, and some letters
I reckon. Send them to Miss Myra Anderson,
Tombstone, care of one of the restaurants. I don&#8217;t
know which one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Send nothin&#8217;,&#8221; sneered Dutch, and coupled it
with a remark no decent man makes of a woman
on a guess.</p>
<p>Because of poor Mac lying there with the little
hole in his temple Curry boiled over. With a jerk
his right arm was free. It shot out like a pile-driver,
all his weight behind the blow. Dutch went
down as if a charging bull had flung him.</p>
<p>Almost simultaneously Curly hit the sand hard.
Before he could stir three men were straddled over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
his anatomy. One of them ground his head into
the dust.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would, eh? We&#8217;ll see about that. Jake,
bring yore rope.&#8221;</p>
<p>They tied the hands of the boy, hauled him to his
feet, and set him astride a horse. In the distance
a windmill of the Circle C ranch was shining in
the morning sun. Toward the group of buildings
clustered around this two of his captors started
with Flandrau. A third was already galloping
toward the ranch house to telephone for a doctor.</p>
<p>As they rode along a fenced lane which led to
the house a girl came flying down the steps. She
swung herself to the saddle just vacated by the
messenger and pulled the horse round for a start.
At sight of those coming toward her she called
out quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;How is dad?&#8221; The quiver of fear broke in her
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217; know yet, Miss Kate,&#8221; answered one of
the men. &#8220;He&#8217;s right peart though. Says for to
tell you not to worry. Don&#8217;t you, either. We&#8217;ve
got here the mangy son of a gun that did it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before he had finished she was off like an arrow
shot from a bow, but not until her eyes had fallen
on the youth sitting bareheaded and bloody between
the guns of his guard. Curly noticed that she had
given a shudder, as one might at sight of a mangled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
mad dog which had just bit a dear friend. Long
after the pounding of her pony&#8217;s hoofs had died
away the prisoner could see the startled eyes of fear
and horror that had rested on him. As Curly kicked
his foot out of the stirrup to dismount a light spring
wagon rolled past him. In its bed were a mattress
and pillows. The driver whipped up the horse and
went across the prairie toward Dry Sandy Creek.
Evidently he was going to bring home the wounded
man.</p>
<p>His guards put Flandrau in the bunk house and
one of them sat at the door with a rifle across his
knees. The cook, the stable boy, and redheaded
Bob Cullison, a nephew of the owner of the ranch,
peered past the <i>vaquero</i> at the captive with the same
awe they would have yielded to a caged panther.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, he&#8217;s only a kid, Buck,&#8221; the cook whispered.</p>
<p>Buck chewed tobacco impassively. &#8220;Old enough
to be a rustler and a killer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob&#8217;s blue eyes were wide with interest &#8220;I&#8217;ll
bet he&#8217;s a regular Billy the Kid,&#8221; murmured the
half-grown boy to the other lad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. Course he is. He&#8217;s got bad eyes all
right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet he&#8217;s got notches on his gun. Say, if
Uncle Luck dies&mdash;&#8221; Bob left the result to the
imagination.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>The excitement at the Circle C increased. Horses
cantered up. Men shouted to each other the news.
Occasionally some one came in to have a look at
the &#8220;bad man&#8221; who had shot Luck Cullison. Young
Flandrau lay on a cot and stared at the ceiling,
paying no more attention to them than if they had
been blocks of wood. It took no shrewdness to see
that there burned in them a still cold anger toward
him that might easily find expression in lynch
law.</p>
<p>The crunch of wagon wheels over disintegrated
granite drifted to the bunk house.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re bringing the boss back,&#8221; Buck announced
from the door to one of his visitors.</p>
<p>The man joined him and looked over his shoulder.
&#8220;Miss Kate there too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep. Say, if the old man don&#8217;t pull through
it will break her all up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy on the bed turned his face to the wall.
He had not cried for ten years, but now he would
have liked the relief of tears. The luck had broken
bad for him, but it would be the worst ever if
his random shot were to make Kate Cullison an
orphan. A big lump rose in his throat and would
not stay down. The irony of it was that he was
staged for the part of a gray wolf on the howl,
while he felt more like a little child that has lost
its last friend.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>After a time there came again the crisp roll of
wheels.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doc Brown,&#8221; announced Buck casually to the
other men in the bunk house.</p>
<p>There was more than one anxious heart at the
Circle C waiting for the verdict of the bowlegged
baldheaded little man with the satchel, but not one
of them&mdash;no, not even Kate Cullison herself&mdash;was
in a colder fear than Curly Flandrau. He was
entitled to a deep interest, for if Cullison should
die he knew that he would follow him within a
few hours. These men would take no chances with
the delays of the law.</p>
<p>The men at the bunk house had offered more
than once to look at Curly&#8217;s arm, but the young man
declined curtly. The bleeding had stopped, but
there was a throb in it as if someone were twisting
a red-hot knife in the wound. After a time Doctor
Brown showed up in the doorway of the men&#8217;s
quarters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another patient here, they tell me,&#8221; he grunted
in the brusque way that failed to conceal the kindest
of hearts.</p>
<p>Buck nodded toward Flandrau.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have a look at your arm, young fellow,&#8221;
the doctor ordered, mopping his bald head with a
big bandanna handkerchief.</p>
<p>&#8220;What about the boss?&#8221; asked Jake presently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mighty sick man, looks like. Tell you more
to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean that he&mdash;that he may not get
well?&#8221; Curly pumped out, his voice not quite
steady.</p>
<p>Doctor Brown looked at him curiously. Somehow
this boy did not fit the specifications of the
desperado that had been poured into his ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know yet. Won&#8217;t make any promises.&#8221;
He had been examining the wound in a businesslike
way. &#8220;Looks like the bullet&#8217;s still in there.
Have to give you an anesthetic while I dig it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; doing,&#8221; retorted Flandrau. &#8220;You
round up the pill in there and I&#8217;ll stand the grief.
When this lead hypodermic jabbed into my arm
it sorter gave me one of them annie-what-d&#8217;ye-call-&#8217;em&mdash;and
one&#8217;s a-plenty for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll hurt,&#8221; the little man explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Expect I&#8217;ll find that out. Go to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brown had not been for thirty years carrying
a medicine case across the dusty deserts of the
frontier without learning to know men. He made
no further protest but set to work.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later Curly lay back on the bunk
with a sudden faintness. He was very white about
the lips, but he had not once flinched from the instruments.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>The doctor washed his hands and his tools, pulled
on his coat, and came across to the patient.</p>
<p>&#8220;Feeling like a fighting cock, are you? Ready to
tackle another posse?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not quite.&#8221; The prisoner glanced toward his
guards and his voice fell to a husky whisper. &#8220;Say,
Doc. Pull Cullison through. Don&#8217;t let him die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmp! Do my best, young fellow. Seems to
me you&#8217;re thinking of that pretty late.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brown took up his medicine case and went back
to the house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>AT THE END OF THE ROAD</h3>
</div>

<p>Curly&#8217;s wooden face told nothing of what he
was thinking. The first article of the creed of the
frontier is to be game. Good or bad, the last test
of a man is the way he takes his medicine. So now
young Flandrau ate his dinner with a hearty appetite,
smoked cigarettes impassively, and occasionally
chatted with his guards casually and as a matter
of course. Deep within him was a terrible feeling
of sickness at the disaster that had overwhelmed
him, but he did not intend to play the quitter.</p>
<p>Dutch and an old fellow named Sweeney relieved
the other watchers about noon. The squat puncher
came up and looked down angrily at the boy lying
on the bunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll serve notice right now that if you make any
breaks I&#8217;ll fill your carcass full of lead,&#8221; he growled.</p>
<p>The prisoner knew that he was nursing a grudge
for the blow that had floored him. Not to be
bluffed, Curly came back with a jeer. &#8220;Much
obliged, my sawed-off and hammered-down friend.
But what&#8217;s the matter with your face? It looks
some lopsided. Did a mule kick you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sweeney gave his companion the laugh. &#8220;Better
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
let him alone, Dutch. If he lands on you again
like he did before your beauty ce&#8217;tainly will be
spoiled complete.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little puncher&#8217;s eyes snapped rage. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
get yours pretty soon, Mr. Curly Flandrau. The
boys are fixin&#8217; to hang yore hide up to dry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does look that way, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; the boy agreed
quietly.</p>
<p>As the day began to wear out it looked so more
than ever. Two riders from the Bar Double M
reached the ranch and were brought in to identify
him as the horse thief. The two were Maloney
and Kite Bonfils, neither of them friends of the
young rustler. The foreman in particular was a
wet blanket to his chances. The man&#8217;s black eyes
were the sort that never soften toward the follies
and mistakes of youth.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got the right man all right,&#8221; he said to
Buck without answering Flandrau&#8217;s cool nod of
recognition.</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of a reputation has he got?&#8221; Buck
asked, lowering his voice a little.</p>
<p>Kite did not take the trouble to lower his. &#8220;Bad.
Always been a tough character. Friend of Bad Bill
Cranston and Soapy Stone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dutch chipped in. &#8220;Shot up the Silver Dollar
saloon onct. Pretty near beat Pete Schiff&#8217;s head
off another time.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></p>
<p>Curly laughed rather wildly. &#8220;That&#8217;s right.
Keep a-coming, boys. Your turn now, Maloney.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Might as well have it all,&#8221; Buck
agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything against the kid, barring
that he&#8217;s been a little wild,&#8221; Maloney testified. &#8220;And
I reckon we ain&#8217;t any of us prize Sunday school
winners for that matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we all friends of Soapy Stone and Bad
Bill? Do we all rustle stock and shoot up good
citizens?&#8221; Dutch shrilled.</p>
<p>Maloney&#8217;s blue Irish eyes rested on the little
puncher for a moment, then passed on as if he had
been weighed and found wanting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed,&#8221; he said to nobody in particular,
&#8220;that them hollering loudest for justice are most
generally the ones that would hate to have it done
to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dutch bristled like a turkey rooster. &#8220;What do
you mean by that?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Irishman smiled derisively. &#8220;I reckon you
can guess if you try real hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dutch fumed, but did no guessing out loud. His
reputation was a whitewashed one. Queer stories
had been whispered about him. He had been a
nester, and it was claimed that calves certainly not
his had been found carrying his brand. The man
had been full of explanations, but there came a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
time when explanations no longer were accepted.
He was invited to become an absentee at his earliest
convenience. This was when he had been living
across the mountains. Curly had been one of those
who had given the invitation. He had taken the
hint and left without delay. Now he was paying
the debt he owed young Flandrau.</p>
<p>Though the role Curly had been given was that
of the hardened desperado he could not quite live
up to the part. As Buck turned to leave the bunk
house the boy touched him on the arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;How about Cullison?&#8221; he asked, very low.</p>
<p>But Buck would not have it that way. &#8220;What
about him?&#8221; he demanded out load, his voice grating
like steel when it grinds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he&mdash;how is he doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s eatin&#8217; you? Ain&#8217;t he dying fast enough
to suit you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Flandrau shrank from the cruel words, as a
schoolboy does from his teacher when he jumps at
him with a cane. He understood how the men were
feeling, but to have it put into words like this
cut him deeply.</p>
<p>It was then that Maloney made a friend of the
young man for life. He let a hand drop carelessly
on Curly&#8217;s shoulder and looked at him with a
friendly smile in his eyes, just as if he knew that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
this was no wolf but a poor lost dog up against it
hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doc thinks he&#8217;ll make it all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>But there were times when Curly wondered
whether it would make any difference to him
whether Cullison got well or not. Something immediate
was in the air. Public opinion was sifting
down to a decision. There were wise nods, and
whisperings, and men riding up and going off again
in a hurry. There had been a good deal of lawlessness
of late, for which Soapy Stone&#8217;s band of
followers was held responsible. Just as plainly as
if he had heard the arguments of Dutch and Kite
Bonfils he knew that they were urging the others to
make an example of him. Most of these men were
well up to the average for the milk of human kindness.
They were the squarest citizens in Arizona.
But Flandrau knew they would snuff out his life
just the same if they decided it was best. Afterward
they might regret it, but that would not help
him.</p>
<p>Darkness came, and the lamps were lit. Again
Curly ate and smoked and chatted a little with his
captors. But as he sat there hour after hour, feeling
death creep closer every minute, cold shivers ran
up and down his spine.</p>
<p>They began to question him, at first casually and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
carelessly, so it seemed to Curly. But presently he
discerned a drift in the talk. They were trying to
find out who had been his partners in the rustling.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I reckon Soapy and Bad Bill left you lads
at Saguache to hold the sack,&#8221; Buck suggested
sympathetically.</p>
<p>Curly grew wary. He did not intend to betray
his accomplices. &#8220;Wrong guess. Soapy and Bad
Bill weren&#8217;t in this deal,&#8221; he answered easily.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know there were two others in it with you.
I guess they were Soapy and Bad Bill all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no law against guessing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The foreman of the Bar Double M interrupted
impatiently, tired of trying to pump out the information
by finesse. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to speak, Flandrau.
You&#8217;ve got to tell us who was engineering this
theft. Understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>The young rustler looked at the grim frowning
face and his heart sank. &#8220;Got to tell you, have I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out with it,&#8221; ordered Buck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I expect I&#8217;ll keep that under my hat,&#8221; Curly
told them lightly.</p>
<p>They were crowded about him in a half circle,
nearly a score of hard leather-faced plainsmen.
Some of them were riders of the Circle C outfit.
Others had ridden over from neighboring ranches.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
All of them plainly meant business. They meant
to stamp out rustling, and their determination had
been given an edge by the wounding of Luck Cullison,
the most popular man in the county.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think again, Curly,&#8221; advised Sweeney quietly.
&#8220;The boys ain&#8217;t trifling about this thing. They
mean to find out who was in the rustling of the
Bar Double M stock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not through me, they won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Through you. And right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>A dozen times during the evening Curly had
crushed down the desire to beg for mercy, to cry
out desperately for them to let him off. He had
kept telling himself not to show yellow, that it
would not last long. Now the fear of breaking
down sloughed from his soul. He rose from the
bed and looked round at the brown faces circled
about him in the shine of the lamps.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not tell you a thing&mdash;not a thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stood there chalk-faced, his lips so dry that
he had to keep moistening them with the tip of
his tongue. Two thoughts hammered in his head.
One was that he had come to the end of his trail,
the other that he would game it out without weakening.</p>
<p>Dutch had a new rope in his hand with a loop at
one end. He tossed it over the boy&#8217;s head and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
drew it taut. Two or three of the faces in the
circle were almost as bloodless as that of the prisoner,
but they were set to see the thing out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you tell now?&#8221; Bonfils asked.</p>
<p>Curly met him eye to eye. &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along then.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the men caught his arm at the place
where he had been wounded. The rustler flinched.</p>
<p>&#8220;Careful, Buck. Don&#8217;t you see you&#8217;re hurting
his bad arm?&#8221; Sweeney said sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. Take him right under the shoulder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no call to be rough with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t aim to hurt him,&#8221; Buck defended himself.</p>
<p>His grip was loose and easy now. Like the
others he was making it up to his conscience for
what he meant to do by doing it in the kindest way
possible.</p>
<p>Curly&#8217;s senses had never been more alert. He
noticed that Buck had on a red necktie that had got
loose from his shirt and climbed up his neck. It
had black polka dots and was badly frayed. Sweeney
was chewing tobacco. He would have that chew
in his mouth after they had finished what they were
going to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t he the gamest ever?&#8221; someone whispered.</p>
<p>The rustler heard the words and they braced him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
as a drink of whiskey does a man who has been on
a bad spree. His heart was chill with fear, but he
had strung his will not to let him give way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better do it at the cottonwoods down by the
creek,&#8221; Buck told Bonfils in a low voice.</p>
<p>The foreman of the Bar Double M moved his
head in assent. &#8220;All right. Let&#8217;s get it over quick
as we can.&#8221;</p>
<p>A sound of flying feet came from outside. Someone
smothered an oath of surprise. Kate Cullison
stood in the doorway, all out of breath and panting.</p>
<p>She took the situation in before she spoke, guessed
exactly what they intended to do. Yet she flung
her imperious question at them.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>They had not a word to say for themselves. In
that room were some of the most callous hearts in
the territory. Not one man in a million could have
phased them, but this slender girl dumfounded them.
Her gaze settled on Buck. His wandered for help
to Sweeney, to Jake, to Kite Bonfils.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now look-a-here, Miss Kate,&#8221; Sweeney began
to explain.</p>
<p>But she swept his remonstrance aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;No&mdash;No!&#8221; Her voice gathered strength
with each repetition of the word. &#8220;I won&#8217;t have it.
What are you thinking about?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>To the boy with the rope around his neck she
was an angel from heaven as she stood there so slim
and straight, her dark eyes shining like stars. Some
of these men were old enough to be her father.
Any of them could have crushed her with one hand.
But if a thunderbolt had crashed in their midst it
could not have disturbed the vigilantes more.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a rustler, Miss Kate; belongs to Soapy
Stone&#8217;s outfit,&#8221; Sweeney answered the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you prove it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We got him double cinched.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let the law put him in prison.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He shot yore paw,&#8221; Buck reminded her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that why you&#8217;re doing it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; and &#8220;That&#8217;s why,&#8221; they nodded.</p>
<p>Like a flash she took advantage of their admission.
&#8220;Then I&#8217;ve got more against him than you
have, and I say turn him over to the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d get a good lawyer and wiggle out,&#8221; Dutch
objected.</p>
<p>She whirled on the little puncher. &#8220;You know
how that is, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Somebody laughed. It was known that Dutch
had once been tried for stealing a sheep and had
been acquitted.</p>
<p>Kite pushed forward, rough and overbearing.
&#8220;Now see here. We know what we&#8217;re doing and
we know why we&#8217;re doing it. This ain&#8217;t any business
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
for a girl to mix in. You go back to the house
and nurse your father that this man shot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So it isn&#8217;t the kind of business for a girl,&#8221; she
answered scornfully. &#8220;It&#8217;s work for a man, isn&#8217;t
it? No, not for one. For nine&mdash;eleven&mdash;thirteen&mdash;seventeen
big brave strong men to hang one poor
wounded boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again that amused laugh rippled out. It came
from Maloney. He was leaning against the door
jamb with his hands in his pockets. Nobody had
noticed him before. He had come in after the girl.
When Curly came to think it over later, if he had
been given three guesses as to who had told Kate
Cullison what was on the program he would have
guessed Maloney each time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that you&#8217;ve relieved your mind proper,
Miss Cullison, I expect any of the boys will be glad
to escort you back to the house,&#8221; Kite suggested
with an acid smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you got to do with this?&#8221; she flamed.
&#8220;Our boys took him. They brought him here as
their prisoner. Do you think we&#8217;ll let you come
over into this county and dictate everything we
do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a notion tucked away that you&#8217;re trying
to do the dictating your own self,&#8221; the Bar
Double M man contradicted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not. But I won&#8217;t stand by while you get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
these boys to do murder. If they haven&#8217;t sense
enough to keep them from it I&#8217;ve got to stop it
myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kite laughed sarcastically. &#8220;You hear your boss,
boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve had yore say now, Miss Kate. I reckon
you better say good-night,&#8221; advised Buck.</p>
<p>She handed Buck and his friends her compliments
in a swift flow of feminine ferocity.</p>
<p>Maloney pushed into the circle. &#8220;She&#8217;s dead
right, boys. There&#8217;s nothing to this lynching game.
He&#8217;s only a kid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not such a kid but what he can do murder,&#8221;
Dutch spat out.</p>
<p>Kate read him the riot act so sharply that the
little puncher had not another word to say. The
tide of opinion was shifting. Those who had been
worked up to the lynching by the arguments of
Bonfils began to resent his activity. Flandrau was
their prisoner, wasn&#8217;t he? No use going off half
cocked. Some of them were discovering that they
were not half so anxious to hang him as they had
supposed.</p>
<p>The girl turned to her friends and neighbors. &#8220;I
oughtn&#8217;t to have talked to you that way, but you
know how worried I am about Dad,&#8221; she apologized
with a catch in her breath. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure you didn&#8217;t
think or you would never have done anything to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
trouble me more just now. You know I didn&#8217;t half
mean it.&#8221; She looked from one to another, her
eyes shiny with tears. &#8220;I know that no braver or
kinder men live than you. Why, you&#8217;re my folks.
I&#8217;ve been brought up among you. And so you&#8217;ve
got to forgive me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some said &#8220;Sure,&#8221; others told her to forget it,
and one grass widower drew a laugh by saying that
her little spiel reminded him of happier days.</p>
<p>For the first time a smile lit her face. The boy
for whose life she was pleading thought it was like
sunshine after a storm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;ve changed your minds. I knew
you would when you thought it over,&#8221; she told them
chattily and confidentially.</p>
<p>She was taking their assent for granted. Now
she waited and gave them a chance to chorus their
agreement. None of them spoke except Maloney.
Most of them were with her in sympathy but none
wanted to be first in giving way. Each wanted
to save his face, so that the others could not later
blame him for quitting first.</p>
<p>She looked around from one to another, still
cheerful and sure of her ground apparently. Two
steps brought her directly in front of one. She
caught him by the lapels of his coat and looked
straight into his eyes. &#8220;You <i>have</i> changed your
mind, haven&#8217;t you, Jake?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>The big Missourian twisted his hat in embarrassment.
&#8220;I reckon I have, Miss Kate. Whatever the
other boys say,&#8221; he got out at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you a mind of your own, Jake?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. Whatever&#8217;s right suits me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you know what is right, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you won&#8217;t hurt this man, our prisoner?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t a thing against him if you haven&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you won&#8217;t hurt him? You won&#8217;t stand by
and let the other boys do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Miss Kate&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She burst into sudden tears. &#8220;I thought you
were my friend, but now I&#8217;m in trouble you&mdash;you
think only of making it worse. I&#8217;m worried to
death about Dad&mdash;and you&mdash;you make me stay here&mdash;away
from him&mdash;and torment me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jake gave in immediately and the rest followed
like a flock of sheep. Two or three of the promises
came hard, but she did not stop till each one individually
had pledged himself. And all the time
she was cajoling them, explaining how good it was
of them to think of avenging her father, how in
one way she did not blame them at all, though of
course they had seen it would not do as soon as
they gave the matter a second thought. Dad would
be so pleased at them when he heard about it, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
she wanted them to know how much she liked and
admired them. It was quite a love feast.</p>
<p>The young man she had saved could not keep his
eyes from her. He would have liked to kneel down
and kiss the edge of her dress and put his curly
head in the dust before her. The ice in his heart
had melted in the warmth of a great emotion. She
was standing close to him talking to Buck when
he spoke in a low voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I can&#8217;t tell you&mdash;how much I&#8217;m obliged
to you, Miss.&#8221;</p>
<p>She drew back quickly as if he had been a snake
about to strike, her hand instinctively gathering
her skirts so that they would not brush against him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want your thanks,&#8221; she told him, and
her voice was like the drench of an icy wave.</p>
<p>But when she saw the hurt in his eyes she hesitated.
Perhaps she guessed that he was human
after all, for an impulse carried her forward to
take the rope from his neck. While his heart beat
twice her soft fingers touched his throat and grazed
his cheek. Then she turned and was gone from
the room.</p>
<p>It was a long time before the bunk house quieted.
Curly, faint with weariness, lay down and tried to
sleep. His arm was paining a good deal and he
felt feverish. The men of the Circle C and their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
guests sat down and argued the whole thing over.
But after a time the doctor came in and had the
patient carried to the house. He was put in a good
clean bed and his arm dressed again.</p>
<p>The doctor brought him good news. &#8220;Cullison
is doing fine. He has dropped into a good sleep.
He&#8217;d ought to make it all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly thought about the girl who had fought for
his life.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not let him die, Doc,&#8221; he begged.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s too tough for that, Luck Cullison is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently Doctor Brown gave him a sleeping
powder and left him. Soon after that Curly fell
asleep and dreamed about a slim dark girl with fine
longlashed eyes that could be both tender and ferocious.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE CULLISONS</h3>
</div>

<p>Curly was awakened by the sound of the cook
beating the call to breakfast on a triangle. Buck
was standing beside the bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;re they coming this glad mo&#8217;ning, son?&#8221;
he inquired with a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine and dandy,&#8221; grinned back Flandrau.</p>
<p>So he was, comparatively speaking. The pain
in his arm had subsided. He had had a good sleep.
And he was lying comfortably in a clean bed instead
of hanging by the neck from the limb of
one of the big cottonwoods on the edge of the
creek.</p>
<p>A memory smote him and instantly he was grave
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;How is Cullison?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good as the wheat, doc says. Mighty lucky for
Mr. C. Flandrau that he is. Say, I&#8217;m to be yore
valley and help you into them clothes. Git a wiggle
on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck escorted his prisoner over to the ranch mess
house. The others had finished breakfast but
Maloney was still eating. His mouth was full of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
hot cakes, but he nodded across at Curly in a casual
friendly way.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s the villain in the play this mo&#8217;ning?&#8221; he
inquired.</p>
<p>Twenty-one usually looks on the cheerful side
of life. Curly had forgotten for the moment about
what had happened to his friend Mac. He did not
remember that he was in the shadow of a penitentiary
sentence. The sun was shining out of a
deep blue sky. The vigor of youth flowed through
his veins. He was hungry and a good breakfast was
before him. For the present these were enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me, I&#8217;m feeling a heap better than I was last
night,&#8221; he admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Came pretty near losing him out of the cast,
didn&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Might a-turned out that way if the stage manager
had not remembered the right cue in time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly was looking straight into the eyes twinkling
across the table at him. Maloney knew that
the young fellow was thanking him for having
saved his life. He nodded lightly, but his words
still seemed to make a jest of the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enter the heroine. Spotlight. Sa-a-ved,&#8221; he
drawled.</p>
<p>The heart of the prisoner went out to this man
who was reaching a hand to him in his trouble.
He had always known that Maloney was true and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
steady as a snubbing post, but he had not looked
for any kindness from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kite just got a telephone message from
Saguache,&#8221; the Bar Double M man went on easily.
&#8220;Your friends that bought the rustled stock didn&#8217;t
get away with the goods. Seems they stumbled
into a bunch of <i>rurales</i> unexpected and had to pull
their freight sudden. The boys from the ranch happened
along about then, claimed ownership and got
possession.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the men bought the stock why didn&#8217;t they
stop and explain?&#8221; asked Buck.</p>
<p>&#8220;That game of buying stolen cattle is worn
threadbare. The <i>rurales</i> and the rangers have had
their eye on those border flitters for quite some
time. So they figured it was safer to dust.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Make their getaway?&#8221; Curly inquired as indifferently
as he could. But in spite of himself a
note of eagerness crept into his voice. For if the
men had escaped that would be two less witnesses
against him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too bad. If they hadn&#8217;t I could have proved by
them I was not one of the men who sold them the
stock,&#8221; Flandrau replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like hell you could,&#8221; Buck snorted, then grinned
at his prisoner in a shamefaced way: &#8220;You&#8217;re a
good one, son.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Luck has been breaking bad for me, but when
things are explained&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It sure will take a lot of explaining to keep
you out of the pen. You&#8217;ll have to be slicker than
Dutch was.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jake stuck his head in at the door. &#8220;Buck, you&#8217;re
needed to help with them two-year-olds. The old
man wants to have a talk with the rustler. Doc
says he may. Maloney, will you take him up to
the house? I&#8217;ll arrange to have you relieved soon
as I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maloney had once ridden for the Circle C and
was friendly with all the men on the place. He
nodded. &#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Mexican woman let them into the chamber
where the wounded man lay. It was a large sunny
southeast room with French windows opening upon
a long porch. Kate was bending over the bed rearranging
the pillows, but she looked up quickly
when the two men entered. Her eyes were still
gentle with the love that had been shining down
from them upon her father.</p>
<p>Cullison spoke. &#8220;Sit down, Dick.&#8221; And to his
prisoner: &#8220;You too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flandrau saw close at hand for the first time the
man who had been Arizona&#8217;s most famous fighting
sheriff. Luck Cullison was well-built and of medium
height, of a dark complexion, clean shaven, wiry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
and muscular. Already past fifty, he looked not a
day more than forty. One glance was enough to
tell Curly the kind of man this was. The power
of him found expression in the gray steel-chilled
eyes that bored into the young outlaw. A child
could have told he was not one to trifle with.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have begun early, young fellow,&#8221; he said
quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Begun what?&#8221; Curly asked, having nothing better
to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what. But never mind that. I don&#8217;t
ask you to convict yourself. I sent for you to tell
you I don&#8217;t blame you for this.&#8221; He touched the
wound in his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Different with your boys, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So the boys are a little excited, are they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They were last night anyhow,&#8221; Curly answered,
with a glimmer of a smile.</p>
<p>Cullison looked quickly at Maloney and then at
his daughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll listen to what you&#8217;ve been hiding from me,&#8221;
he told them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the boys had notions. Miss Kate argued
with them and they saw things different,&#8221; the Bar
Double M rider explained.</p>
<p>But Cullison would not let it go at that. He
made them tell him the whole story. When Curly
and Maloney had finished he buried his daughter&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
little hand in his big brown fist. His eyes were
dancing with pride, but he gave her not a word of
spoken praise.</p>
<p>Kate, somewhat embarrassed, changed the subject
briskly. &#8220;Now you&#8217;re talking too much, Dad.
Doctor Brown said you might see him for just a
few minutes. But you&#8217;re not to tire yourself, so
I&#8217;ll do the talking for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took his orders with the smiling submission
of the man who knows his mistress.</p>
<p>Kate spoke to Curly. &#8220;Father wants me to tell
you that we don&#8217;t blame you for shooting at him.
We understand just how it was. Your friend got
excited and shot as soon as he saw he was surrounded.
We are both very sorry he was killed.
Father could not stop the boys in time. Perhaps
you remember that he tried to get you to surrender.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rustler nodded. &#8220;Yes, I heard him holler to
me to put my gun down, but the others blazed away
at me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And so you naturally defended yourself. That&#8217;s
how we understand it. Father wants it made clear
that he feels you could have done nothing else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Much obliged. I&#8217;ve been sorry ever since I hit
him, and not only on my own account.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then none of us need to hold hard feelings.&#8221;
The girl looked at her father, who answered her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
appeal with a grim nod, and then she turned again
to the young rustler a little timidly. &#8220;I wonder
if you would mind if I asked you a question.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve earned the right to ask as many as you
like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about&mdash;&mdash; We have been told you know
the man they call Soapy Stone. Is that true?&#8221;</p>
<p>Flandrau&#8217;s eyes took on a stony look. It was
as if something had sponged all the boyishness from
his face. Still trying to get him to give away his
partners in the rustling, were they? Well, he would
show them he could take his medicine without
squealing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it is and maybe it isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but you don&#8217;t see what we mean. It isn&#8217;t
that we want to hurt you.&#8221; She spoke in a quick
eager voice of protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you just want me to squeal on my friends
to save my own hide. Nothing doing, Miss Cullison.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. You&#8217;re wrong. Why are you so suspicious?&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly laughed bitterly. &#8220;Your boys were asking
that question about Soapy last night. They had
a rope round my neck at the time. Nothing unfriendly
in the matter, of course. Just a casual
interest in my doings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cullison was looking at him with the steel eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
that bored into him like a gimlet. Now he spoke
sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got an account running with Soapy Stone.
Some day I&#8217;ll settle it likely. But that ain&#8217;t the
point now. Do you know his friends&mdash;the bunch
he trails with?&#8221;</p>
<p>Wariness still seemed to crouch in the cool eyes
of Flandrau.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if I say yes, I&#8217;ll bet your next question
will be about the time and the place I last saw
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kate picked up a photograph from the table and
handed it to the prisoner. &#8220;We&#8217;re not interested in
his friends&mdash;except one of them. Did you ever see
the boy that sat for that picture?&#8221;</p>
<p>The print was a snapshot of a boy about nineteen,
a good looking handsome fellow, a little sulky
around the mouth but with a pair of straight honest
eyes.</p>
<p>Curly shook his head slowly. Yet he was vaguely
reminded of someone he knew. Glancing up, he
found instantly the clew to what had puzzled him.
The young man in the picture was like Kate Cullison,
like her father too for that matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s your brother.&#8221; The words were out before
Flandrau could stop them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. You&#8217;ve never met him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>Cullison had been watching the young man
steadily. &#8220;Never saw him with Soapy Stone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never heard Stone speak of Sam Cullison?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Soapy doesn&#8217;t talk much about who his
friends are.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ex-sheriff nodded. &#8220;I&#8217;ve met him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course he had met him. Curly knew the story
of how in one drive he had made a gather of outlaws
that had brought fame to him. Soapy had
broken through the net, but the sheriff had followed
him into the hills alone and run him to earth. What
passed between the men nobody ever found out.
Stone had repeatedly given it out that he could not
be taken alive. But Cullison had brought him down
to the valley bound and cowed. In due season the
bandits had gone over the road to Yuma. Soapy
and the others had sworn to get their revenge some
day. Now they were back in the hills at their old
tricks. Was it possible that Cullison&#8217;s son was with
them, caught in a trap during some drunken frolic
just as Curly had been? In what way could Stone
pay more fully the debt of hate he owed the former
sheriff than by making his son a villain?</p>
<p>The little doctor came briskly into the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody out but the nurse. You&#8217;ve had company
enough for one day, Luck,&#8221; he announced
cheerily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>Kate followed Maloney and his prisoner to the
porch.</p>
<p>&#8220;About the letters of your friend that was shot,&#8221;
she said to Curly. &#8220;Doctor Brown was telling me
what you said. I&#8217;ll see they reach Miss Anderson.
Do you know in what restaurant she works?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Mac didn&#8217;t tell me.&#8221; The boy gulped to
swallow an unexpected lump in his throat. &#8220;They
was expecting to get married soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;ll write to her,&#8221; Kate promised, her eyes
misty.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be obliged, Miss. Mac was a good boy.
Anyone will tell you that. And he was awful fond
of her. He talked about her that last night before
the camp fire. I led him into this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell her what you say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do. Tell her he felt bad about what he had
done. Bad companions got him going wrong, but
he sure would have settled down into a good man.
That&#8217;s straight goods, too. You write it strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s eyes were shiny with tears. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she
answered softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t any Harvard A. B. Writing letters ain&#8217;t
my long suit. I&#8217;m always disremembering whether
a man had ought to say have went and have knew.
Verbs are the beatingest things. But I know you&#8217;ll
fix it up right so as to let that little girl down
easy.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve changed my mind. I&#8217;ll not write but go to
see her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly could only look his thanks. Words
seemed strangely inadequate. But Kate understood
the boy&#8217;s unspoken wish and nodded her head reassuringly
as he left the room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>LAURA LONDON</h3>
</div>

<p>Kite Bonfils and Maloney took Curly back to
Saguache and turned him over to Sheriff Bolt.</p>
<p>&#8220;How about bail?&#8221; Maloney asked.</p>
<p>The sheriff smiled. He was a long lean leather-faced
man with friendly eyes from which humorous
wrinkles radiated.</p>
<p>&#8220;You honing to go bail for him, Dick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, say two thousand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;</p>
<p>A cowpuncher with fifty dollars two weeks after
pay day was a rarity. No wonder Bolt was surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not my money. Luck Cullison is going bail
for him,&#8221; Maloney explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Luck Cullison!&#8221; Maloney&#8217;s words had surprised
the exclamation from Curly. Why should the
owner of the Circle C of all men go bail for him?</p>
<p>The sheriff commented dryly on the fact. &#8220;I
thought this kid was the one that shot him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was just a happenstance. Curly shot to
save his bacon. Luck don&#8217;t hold any grudge.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So I should judge. Luck gave you his check,
did he?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bolt belonged to the political party opposed to
Cullison. He had been backed by Cass Fendrick,
a sheepman in feud with the cattle interests and
in particular with the Circle C outfit. But he could
not go back on his word. He and Maloney called
together on the district attorney. An hour later
Dick returned to the jail.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, kid,&#8221; he told Curly. &#8220;You can
shake off the dust of Saguache from your hoofs till
court meets in September.&#8221;</p>
<p>To Flandrau the news seemed too good for the
truth. Less than twenty-four hours ago he had been
waiting for the end of the road with a rope around
his neck. Now he was free to slip a saddle on his
pony Keno and gallop off as soon as he pleased.
How such a change had been brought about he did
not yet understand.</p>
<p>While he and Maloney were sitting opposite each
other at the New Orleans Hash House waiting for
a big steak with onions he asked questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t savvy Cullison&#8217;s play. Whyfor is he
digging up two thousand for me? How does he
know I won&#8217;t cut my stick for Mexico?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do I know it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, do you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>Maloney helped himself to the oyster crackers to
pass the time. &#8220;Sure I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Search me. But I know you&#8217;ll be here in September
if you&#8217;re alive and kicking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flandrau persisted. &#8220;But Luck don&#8217;t owe me
anything, except one pill sent promiscuous to his
address. What&#8217;s he going down into his jeans for?
Will you tell me that? And shove them crackers
north by east. Got to fill up on something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you as good a guesser as I am, Curly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, here&#8217;s my guess. Miss Kate made
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon maybe she influenced him. But why
did she? You don&#8217;t figure that curly topknot of
yours is disturbing her dreams any, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quit your joshing and tell me why.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you for sure. But here&#8217;s my guess.
Don&#8217;t cost you a cent if you ain&#8217;t satisfied with it.
First off, there was poor Mac shot by the Circle C
boys. Course Mac was a horse thief, but then he
was a kid too. That worried the little girl some.
She got to thinking about brother Sam and how
he might be in the same fix one of these days as
you are now. He&#8217;s on her mind a good deal, Sam
is. Same way with the old man too, I reckon,
though he don&#8217;t say much. Well, she decided Soapy
Stone had led you astray like he&#8217;s doing with Sam.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
It got to worrying her for fear her brother might
need a friend some time. So she handed over her
worry to the old man and made him dig up for
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about it. Tell me what you know of
Sam. Is he as white as the rest of the family?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sam is all right, but he has got off wrong foot
first. He and the old man got to kind of disagreeing,
for the kid was a wild colt. Come by it honestly from
the old man too. Well, they had a row one time
when Sam got into trouble. Luck told him he
never wanted to see him again. Sam lit out, and
next folks knew he was trailing with Soapy&#8217;s gang.
Consequence is, Sam&#8217;s hitting the toboggan for
Tophet by all accounts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like some one ought to be able to pry him
loose from that bunch,&#8221; Curly mused aloud.</p>
<p>Maloney grinned across at him. &#8220;You try it,
son. You&#8217;ve always led a good pious life. He
sure would listen to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had said it as a jest, but Curly did not laugh.
Why not? Why shouldn&#8217;t he hunt up Sam and
let him know how his folks were worrying about
him? What was to hinder him from trying to
wipe out some of the big debt he owed the Cullison
family? He was footloose till September and out
of a job. For he could not go back to the Map of
Texas with his hat in his hand and a repentant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
whine on his lips. Why not take a hike into the
hills and round up the boy? Of course Sam might
not listen to him, but he could not tell that till he
had tried. It had taken him scarcely a moment
to make up his mind. The smile had not yet died
out of Maloney&#8217;s eyes when he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn if I don&#8217;t take a crack at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man on the other side of the table stared at
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning that, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Might be some lively if Soapy gets wise to your
intentions,&#8221; he said in a casual sort of way.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t aim to declare them out loud.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was all they said about it at the time. The
rest of the evening was devoted to pleasure. After
dinner they took in a moving picture show. The
first film was a Western melodrama and it pleased
them both immensely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be afraid to live in a country where guns
popped like they do in moving picture land,&#8221; Curly
drawled. &#8220;Where is it anyhow? It ain&#8217;t Texas,
nor Oklahoma, nor Wyoming, nor Montana, nor
any of the spots in between, because I&#8217;ve been in all
of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maloney laughed. &#8220;Day before yesterday that&#8217;s
the way I&#8217;d a-talked my own self, but now I know
better. What about your little stunt? Wasn&#8217;t that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
warm enough for you? Didn&#8217;t guns pop enough?
Don&#8217;t you talk about moving pictures!&#8221;</p>
<p>After the picture show there were other things.
But both of them trod the narrow path, Maloney
because he was used to doing so and Flandrau
because his experiences had sobered him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m on the water wagon, Dick.&#8221; He grinned
ruefully at his friend. &#8220;Nothing like locking the
stable after your bronc&#8217;s been stole. I&#8217;d a-been a
heap better off if I&#8217;d got on the wagon a week
ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since their way was one for several miles Maloney
and Curly took the road together next morning
at daybreak. Their ponies ambled along side by
side at the easy gait characteristic of the Southwest.
Steadily they pushed into the brown baked desert.
Little dust whirls in the shape of inverted cones
raced across the sand wastes. The heat danced
along the road in front of them in shimmering
waves.</p>
<p>Your plainsman is a taciturn individual. These
two rode for an hour without exchanging a syllable.
Then Curly was moved to talk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you tell me how it is a man can get fond
of so Godforsaken a country? Cactus and greasewood
and mesquite, and for a change mesquite and
greasewood and cactus! Nothing but sand washes
and sand hills, except the naked mountains &#8217;way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
off with their bones sticking through. But in the
mo&#8217;ning like this, when the world&#8217;s kind o&#8217; smiley
with the sunshine, or after dark when things are
sorter violet soft and the mountains lose their
edges&mdash;say, would you swap it for any other country
on earth?&#8221;</p>
<p>Maloney nodded. He had felt that emotion a
hundred times, though he had never put it into
words.</p>
<p>At Willow Wash their ways diverged. They
parted with a casual &#8220;So-long; see you later.&#8221;
Curly was striking for the headwaters of Dead
Cow Creek, where Soapy Stone had a horse ranch.</p>
<p>He put up that night at the place of a nester
in the foothills. His host looked at him curiously
when he mentioned his destination, but he did not
say anything. It was none of his business how
many young fellows rode to Soapy&#8217;s ranch.</p>
<p>Flandrau took the trail again next morning after
breakfast. About two o&#8217;clock he reached a little
park in the hills, in the middle of which, by a dry
creek, lay a ranch.</p>
<p>The young man at first thought the place was
deserted for the day, but when he called a girl
appeared at the door. She smiled up at him with
the lively interest any ranch girl may be expected
to feel in a stranger who happens to be both young
and good looking.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p>She was a young person of soft curves and engaging
dimples. Beneath the brown cheeks of
Arizona was a pink that came and went very attractively.</p>
<p>Curly took off his dusty gray hat. &#8220;<i>Buenos
tardes; senorita!</i> I&#8217;ll bet I&#8217;m too late to draw any
dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Buenos, senor</i>,&#8221; she answered promptly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
bet you&#8217;d lose your money.&#8221;</p>
<p>He swung from the saddle. &#8220;That&#8217;s good hearing.
When a fellow has had his knees clamped to
the side of a bronch for seven hours he&#8217;s sure ready
for the dinner bell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can wash over there by the pump. There&#8217;s
a towel on the fence.&#8221;</p>
<p>She disappeared into the house, and Curly took
care of his horse, washed, and sauntered back to the
porch. He could smell potatoes frying and could
hear the sizzling of ham and eggs.</p>
<p>While he ate the girl flitted in and out, soft-footed
and graceful, replenishing his plate from time to
time.</p>
<p>Presently he discovered that her father was away
hunting strays on Sunk Creek, that the nearest
neighbor was seven miles distant, and that Stone&#8217;s
ranch was ten miles farther up Dead Cow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever meet a lad called Sam Cullison?&#8221; the guest
asked carelessly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>Curly was hardly prepared to see the color whip
into her cheeks or to meet the quick stabbing look
she fastened on him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re looking for him, are you?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought while I was here I&#8217;d look him up. I
know his folks a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know him?&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head. She looked at him very
steadily before she spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t met him yet but you want to. Is
that it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you have another egg?&#8221;</p>
<p>Flandrau laughed. &#8220;No, thanks. Staying up at
Stone&#8217;s, is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How should I know who&#8217;s staying at Stone&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was quite plain she did not intend to tell anything
that would hurt young Cullison.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, it doesn&#8217;t matter. I ain&#8217;t lost him any
to speak of,&#8221; the young man drawled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you expecting to stop in the hills long&mdash;or
just visiting?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Curly answered, with his most innocent
blank wall look.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes which?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, whichever you like, Miss London. What&#8217;s
worrying you? If you&#8217;ll ask me plain out I&#8217;ll know
how to answer you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So you know my name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything strange about that? The Bar 99 is
the London brand. I saw your calves in the corral
with their flanks still sore. Naturally I assume the
young lady I meet here is Miss Laura London.&#8221;</p>
<p>She defended her suspicions. &#8220;Folks come up
here with their mysterious questions. A person
would think nobody lived on Dead Cow but outlaws
and such, to hear some of you valley people tell it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing mysterious about me and my
questions. I&#8217;m just a lunkheaded cowpuncher out
of a job. What did you think I was?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want with Sam Cullison? Are you
friendly to him? Or aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ladies first. Are <i>you</i> friendly to him? Or
aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly smiled gaily across the table at her. A
faint echo of his pleasantry began to dimple the
corners of her mouth. It lit her eyes and spread
from them till the prettiest face on the creek
wrinkled with mirth. Both of them relaxed to peals
of laughter, and neither of them quite knew the
cause of their hilarity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you!&#8221; she reproved when she had sufficiently
recovered.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you thought I was a detective or a deputy
sheriff. That&#8217;s certainly funny.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For all I know yet you may be one.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I never did see anyone with a disposition so
dark-complected as yours. If you won&#8217;t put them
suspicions to sleep I&#8217;ll have to table my cards.&#8221;
From his pocket he drew a copy of the Saguache
Sentinel and showed her a marked story. &#8220;Maybe
that will explain what I&#8217;m doing up on Dead Cow.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was what Laura London read:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>From Mesa comes the news of another
case of bold and flagrant rustling. On
Friday night a bunch of horses belonging
to the Bar Double M were rounded up
and driven across the mountains to this
city. The stolen animals were sold here
this morning, after which the buyers set
out at once for the border and the thieves
made themselves scarce. It is claimed that
the rustlers were members of the notorious
Soapy Stone outfit. Two of the four were
identified, it is alleged, as William Cranston,
generally known as &#8220;Bad Bill,&#8221; and
a young vaquero called &#8220;Curly&#8221; Flandrau.</p>
<p>At the time of going to press posses
are out after both the outlaws and the
stolen horses. Chances of overtaking both
are considered excellent. All likely points
and outlying ranches have been notified by
telephone whenever possible.</p>
<p>In case the guilty parties are apprehended
the <i>Sentinel</i> hopes an example will
be made of them that will deter others of
like stamp from a practice that has of late
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
been far too common. Lawlessness seems
to come in cycles. Just now the southern
tier of counties appears to be suffering
from such a sporadic attack. Let all good
men combine to stamp it out. The time
has passed when Arizona must stand as a
synonym for anarchy.</p>
</div>
<p>She looked up at the young man breathlessly,
her pretty lips parted, her dilated eyes taking him
in solemnly. A question trembled on her lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say it,&#8221; advised Flandrau.</p>
<p>The courage to ask what she was thinking came
back in a wave. &#8220;Then I will. Are you a rustler?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what the paper says, don&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you this man mentioned here? What&#8217;s
his name&mdash;&#8216;Curly&#8217; Flandrau?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re a rustler?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think? Am I more like a rustler
than a deputy sheriff? Stands to reason I can&#8217;t
be both.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes did not leave him. She brushed aside
his foolery impatiently. &#8220;You don&#8217;t even deny it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t yet. I expect I will later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do men do such things?&#8221; she went on,
letting the hands that held the paper drop into her
lap helplessly. &#8220;You don&#8217;t look bad. Anyone
would think&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>Her sentence tailed out and died away. She was
still looking at Curly, but he could see that her
mind had flown to someone else. He would have
bet a month&#8217;s pay that she was thinking of another
lad who was wild but did not look bad.</p>
<p>Flandrau rose and walked round the table to her.
&#8220;Much obliged, Miss Laura. I&#8217;ll shake hands on
that with you. You&#8217;ve guessed it. Course, me being
so &#8216;notorious&#8217; I hate to admit it, but I ain&#8217;t bad
any more than he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave him a quick shy look. He had made
a center shot she was not expecting. But, womanlike,
she did not admit it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean this &#8216;Bad Bill&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know who I mean all right. His name is
Sam Cullison. And you needn&#8217;t to tell me where
he is. I&#8217;ll find him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you don&#8217;t mean any harm to him.&#8221; But
she said it as if she were pleading with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;C&#8217;rect. I don&#8217;t. Can you tell me how to get
to Soapy Stone&#8217;s horse ranch from here, Miss London?&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed. Her doubts were vanishing like
mist before the sunshine. &#8220;Good guess. At least
he was there the last I heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I expect your information is pretty recent.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>That drew another little laugh accompanied by
a blush.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think I have told you enough for
one day, Mr. Flandrau?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That &#8216;Mr.&#8217; sounds too solemn. My friends call
me &#8216;Curly,&#8217;&#8221; he let her know.</p>
<p>She remembered that he was a stranger and a
rustler and she drew herself up stiffly. This pleasant
young fellow was too familiar.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you take this trail to the scrub pines above,
then keep due north for about four miles, you&#8217;ll
strike the creek again. Just follow the trail along
it to the horse ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that she turned on her heel and walked into
the kitchen.</p>
<p>Curly had not meant to be &#8220;fresh.&#8221; He was always
ready for foolery with the girls, but he was
not the sort to go too far. Now he blamed himself
for having moved too fast. He had offended her
sense of what was the proper thing.</p>
<p>There was nothing for it but to saddle and take
the road.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>A BEAR TRAP</h3>
</div>

<p>The winding trail led up to the scrub pines and
from there north into the hills. Curly had not
traveled far when he heard the sound of a gun fired
three times in quick succession. He stopped to listen.
Presently there came a faint far call for help.</p>
<p>Curly cantered around the shoulder of the hill
and saw a man squatting on the ground. He was
stooped forward in an awkward fashion with his
back to Flandrau.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>
<p>At the question the man looked over his shoulder.
Pain and helpless rage burned in the deep-set black
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing at all. Don&#8217;t you see I&#8217;m just taking
a nap?&#8221; he answered quietly.</p>
<p>Curly recognized him now. The man was Soapy
Stone. Behind the straight thin-lipped mouth a
double row of strong white teeth were clamped
tightly. Little beads of perspiration stood out all
over his forehead. A glance showed the reason.
One of his hands was caught in a bear trap fastened
to a cottonwood. Its jaws held him so that he
could not move.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p>The young man swung from the back of Keno.
He found the limb of a cottonwood about as thick
as his forearm below the elbow. This he set close
to the trap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Soon as I get the lip open shove her in,&#8221; he
told Stone.</p>
<p>The prisoner moistened his dry lips. It was
plain that he was in great pain.</p>
<p>The rescuer slipped the toes of his boots over
the lower lip and caught the upper one with both
hands. Slowly the mouth of the trap opened. Stone
slipped in the wooden wedge and withdrew his
crushed wrist. By great good fortune the steel
had caught on the leather gauntlet he was wearing.
Otherwise it must have mangled the arm to a pulp.</p>
<p>Even now he was suffering a good deal.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to let a doc look at it,&#8221; Curly suggested.</p>
<p>Stone agreed. &#8220;Reckon I better strike for the
Bar 99.&#8221; He was furious at himself for having let
such an accident happen. The veriest tenderfoot
might have known better.</p>
<p>His horse had disappeared, but Curly helped him
to the back of Keno. Together they took the trail
for the Bar 99. On the face of the wounded man
gathered the moisture caused by intense pain. His
jaw was clenched to keep back the groans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hard sledding, looks like,&#8221; Curly sympathized.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Reckon I can stand the grief,&#8221; Stone grunted.</p>
<p>Nor did he speak again until they reached the
ranch and Laura London looked at him from a
frightened face.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ran a sliver in my finger, Miss Laura. Too
bad to trouble you,&#8221; Soapy answered with a sneer
on his thin lips.</p>
<p>A rider for the Bar 99 had just ridden up and
Laura sent him at once for the doctor. She led the
way into the house and swiftly gathered bandages,
a sponge, and a basin of water. Together she and
Curly bathed and wrapped the wound. Stone did
not weaken, though he was pretty gray about the
lips.</p>
<p>Laura was as gentle as she could be.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I&#8217;m hurting you,&#8221; she said, her fingers
trembling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it. Great pleasure to have you for
a nurse. I&#8217;m certainly in luck.&#8221; Curly did not
understand the bitterness in the sardonic face and
he resented it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the doctor would only hurry,&#8221; Laura murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know I&#8217;m a great trouble. Too bad Curly
found me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was busy with the knots of the outer wrapping
and did not look up. &#8220;It is no trouble.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m too meddlesome. Serves me right for being
inquisitive about your father&#8217;s trap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be sorry you were caught.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He&#8217;ll have to climb the hill and reset it.&#8221;</p>
<p>That something was wrong between them Curly
could see. Soapy was very polite in spite of his
bitterness, but his hard eyes watched her as a cat
does a mouse. Moreover, the girl was afraid of
him. He could tell that by the timid startled way
she had of answering. Now why need she fear the
man? It would be as much as his life was worth
to lift a hand to hurt her.</p>
<p>After the doctor had come and had attended to
the crushed wrist Curly stepped out to the porch
to find Laura. She was watering her roses and he
went across the yard to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m right sorry for what I said, Miss Laura.
Once in a while a fellow makes a mistake. If he&#8217;s
as big a chump as I am it&#8217;s liable to happen a little
oftener. But I&#8217;m not really one of those smart
guys.&#8221;</p>
<p>Out came her gloved hand in the firmest of
grips.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that now. You didn&#8217;t think. And I
made a mistake. I thought you were taking advantage
because I had been friendly. I&#8217;m glad you
spoke about it. We&#8217;ll forget it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then maybe we&#8217;ll be friends after all, but I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
sha&#8217;n&#8217;t tell you what my friends call me,&#8221; he answered
gaily.</p>
<p>She laughed out in a sudden bubbling of mirth.
&#8220;Take care.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I will. I won&#8217;t even spell it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He helped her with the watering. Presently she
spoke, with a quick look toward the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something I want to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something I want you to do for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect maybe I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said nothing more for a minute, then the
thing that was troubling her burst from the lips of
the girl as a flame leaps out of a pent fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about that boy he has up there.&#8221; She gave a
hopeless little gesture toward the hills.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sam Cullison?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s bent on ruining him, always has been ever
since he got a hold on him. I can&#8217;t tell you how
I know it, but I&#8217;m sure&mdash;&mdash; And now he&#8217;s more
set on it than ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly thought he could guess why, but he wanted
to make sure. &#8220;Because you are Sam&#8217;s friend?&#8221;</p>
<p>The pink flooded her cheeks. &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And because you won&#8217;t be Soapy Stone&#8217;s
friend?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>She flashed a startled look at him. &#8220;How do you
know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jealous, is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face, buried in the blooms she had been
cutting, was of the same tint as the roses.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so he wants to hurt you through him?&#8221;
Flandrau added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. If he can drag Sam down and get him
into trouble he&#8217;ll pay off two grudges at once. And
he will too. You&#8217;ll see. He&#8217;s wily as an Indian.
For that matter there is Apache blood in him, folks
say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about young Cullison? Can&#8217;t he make a
fight for himself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you know how boys are. Sam is completely
under this man&#8217;s influence.&#8221; Her voice broke a
little. &#8220;And I can&#8217;t help him. I&#8217;m only a girl. He
won&#8217;t listen to me. Besides, Dad won&#8217;t let me
have anything to do with him because of the way
he&#8217;s acting. What Sam needs is a man friend, one
just as strong and determined as Soapy but one who
is good and the right sort of an influence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you picking me for that responsible friend
who is to be such a powerful influence for good?&#8221;
Curly asked with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;yes, I am.&#8221; She looked up at him confidently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you forgotten that little piece in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
<i>Sentinel</i>? How does it go? An example had
ought to be made of the desperadoes, and all the
rest of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what it says. I&#8217;ve seen you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So had the editor.&#8221;</p>
<p>She waved his jests aside. &#8220;Oh, well! You&#8217;ve
done wrong. What of that? Can&#8217;t I tell you are
a man? And I don&#8217;t care how much fun you make
of me. You&#8217;re good too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly met her on the ground of her own seriousness.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you something, Miss Laura. Maybe
you&#8217;ll be glad to know that the reason I&#8217;m going
to the horse ranch is to help Sam Cullison if I
can.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went on to tell her the whole story of what
the Cullisons had done for him. In all that he
said there was not one word to suggest such a
thing, but Laura London&#8217;s mind jumped the gaps
to a knowledge of the truth that Curly himself did
not have. The young man was in love with Kate
Cullison. She was sure of it. Also, she was his
ally in the good cause of romance.</p>
<p>When Curly walked back into the house, Stone
laid down the paper he had been reading.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see the <i>Sentinel</i> hints that Mr. Curly Flandrau
had better be lynched,&#8221; he jeered.</p>
<p>&#8220;The <i>Sentinel</i> don&#8217;t always hit the bull&#8217;s-eye,
Soapy,&#8221; returned the young man evenly. &#8220;It thinks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
I belong to the Soapy Stone outfit, but we know I
haven&#8217;t that honor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no such outfit&mdash;not in the sense he
means,&#8221; snapped the man on the lounge. &#8220;What
are your plans? Where you going to lie low?
Picked a spot yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know where I&#8217;m going, but I&#8217;m on the
way,&#8221; Curly assured him gaily.</p>
<p>Soapy frowned at him under the heavy eyebrows
that gave him so menacing an effect.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better come back with me to the ranch till you
look around.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suits me right down to the ground if it does
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Someone came whistling into the house and
opened the door of the room. He was a big lank
fellow with a shotgun in his hands. &#8220;From Missouri&#8221;
was stamped all over his awkward frame.
He stood staring at his unexpected guests. His
eyes, clashing with those of Stone, grew chill and
hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re back here again, are you?&#8221; he asked,
looking pretty black.</p>
<p>Stone&#8217;s lip smile mocked him. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
how you guessed it, but I sure am here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you to keep away from the Bar 99&mdash;you
and your whole cursed outfit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to me you did mention something of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
that sort. But how was I to know whether you
meant it unless I came back to see?&#8221;</p>
<p>Laura came into the room and ranged herself
beside her father. Her hand rested lightly on his
forearm.</p>
<p>&#8220;He got caught in one of your bear traps and
this young man brought him here to wait for the
doctor,&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmp!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Missourian stared without civility at his
guest, turned on his heel, and with his daughter
beside him marched out of the room. He could not
decently tell Stone to leave while he was under the
care of a doctor, but he did not intend to make him
welcome. London was a blunt grizzled old fellow
who said what he thought even about the notorious
Soapy Stone.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll pull our freights right away, Curly,&#8221;
Stone announced as soon as his host had gone.</p>
<p>The young man went to the stable and saddled
Keno. While he was tightening the cinch a shadow
fell across his shoulder. He did not need to look
round to see whose it was.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re going to the horse ranch.
You will look out for Sam. I trust you. I don&#8217;t
know why, but I have the greatest confidence in
you,&#8221; the owner of the shadow explained sweetly.</p>
<p>Curly smiled blandly over his shoulder at her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
&#8220;Fine! That&#8217;s a good uplifting line of talk, Miss
Laura. Now will you please explain why you&#8217;re
feeding me this particular bunch of taffy? What
is it I&#8217;m to do for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She blushed and laughed at the same time. Her
hand came from behind her back. In it was a
letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I do mean it, every word of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s to be my pay for giving Master Sam his
billy doo, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you guess? It is a letter to Sam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did I guess it? Shows I&#8217;m sure a wiz,
don&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>She saw her father coming and handed him the
letter quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here. Take it.&#8221; A spark of mischief lit her
eye and the dimples came out on her cheeks.
&#8220;Good-by, <i>Curly</i>.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>BAD MEDICINE</h3>
</div>

<p>The house at the horse ranch was a long, low
L-shaped adobe structure. The first impression
Curly received was that of negligence. In places
the roof sagged. A door in the rear hung from
one hinge. More than one broken pane of glass
was stuffed with paper. The same evidence of
shiftlessness could be seen on every hand. Fences
had collapsed and been repaired flimsily. The woodwork
of the well was rotting. The windmill
wheezed and did its work languidly for lack of oil.</p>
<p>Two men were seated on the porch playing seven
up. One was Bad Bill, the other Blackwell. At
sight of Curly they gave up their game.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, kid! Where did you drop from?&#8221; Cranston
asked.</p>
<p>A muscle twitched in Flandrau&#8217;s cheek. &#8220;They
got Mac.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got him! Where? At Saguache?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ran us down near the Circle C. Mac opened
fire. They&mdash;killed him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shot him, or&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221; Curly was left to guess
the other half of the question.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Shot him, and took me prisoner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They couldn&#8217;t prove a thing, could they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They could prove I wounded Cullison. That
was enough for them. They set out to hang me.
Later they changed their minds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How come you here? Did you escape?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope. Friends dug up bail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cranston did not ask what friends. He thought
he knew. Alec Flandrau, an uncle of Curly, owned
a half interest in the Map of Texas ranch. No
doubt he had come to the aid of the young scapegoat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet the old man was sore at having to ante,&#8221;
was Big Bill&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Soapy has been telling me that the Cullison
kid is up here. I reckon we better not say anything
about my mixup with his folks. I&#8217;m not
looking for any trouble with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Curly. That goes with me. How
about you, Blackwell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. What Sam don&#8217;t know won&#8217;t hurt him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly sat down on the porch and told an edited
story of his adventures to them. Before he had
finished a young fellow rode up and dismounted.
He had a bag of quail with him which he handed
over to the Mexican cook. After he had unsaddled
and turned his pony into a corral he joined the card
players on the porch.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>By unanimous consent the game was changed
to poker. Young Cullison had the chair next to
Flandrau. He had, so Curly thought, a strong
family resemblance to his father and sister. &#8220;His
eye jumps straight at you and asks its questions
right off the reel,&#8221; the newcomer thought. Still
a boy in his ways, he might any day receive the
jolt that would transform him into a man.</p>
<p>The cook&#8217;s &#8220;Come and get it&#8221; broke up the game
for a time. They trooped to supper, where for
half an hour they discussed without words fried
quail, cornbread and coffee. Such conversation as
there was held strictly to necessary lines and had to
do with the transportation of edibles.</p>
<p>Supper over, they smoked till the table was
cleared. Then coats were removed and they sat
down to the serious business of an all night session
of draw.</p>
<p>Curly was not playing to win money so much as
to study the characters of those present. Bill he
knew already fairly well as a tough nut to crack,
game to the core, and staunch to his friends. Blackwell
was a bad lot, treacherous, vindictive, slippery
as an eel. Even his confederates did not trust him
greatly. But it was Soapy Stone and young Cullison
that interested Flandrau most. The former
played like a master. He chatted carelessly, but he
overlooked no points. Sam had the qualities that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
go to make a brilliant erratic player, but he lacked
the steadiness and the finesse of the veteran.</p>
<p>The last play before they broke up in the gray
dawn was a flashlight on Stone&#8217;s cool audacity.
The limit had long since been taken off. Blackwell
and Stone had been the winners of the night, and
the rest had all lost more or less.</p>
<p>Curly was dealing, Cranston opened the pot.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s cracked,&#8221; he announced.</p>
<p>Blackwell, sitting next to him, had been waiting
his turn with palpable eagerness. &#8220;Got to boost
her, boys, to protect Bill,&#8221; he explained as his raise
went in.</p>
<p>Sam, who had drunk more than was good for
him, raised in his turn. &#8220;Kick her again, gentlemen.
Me, I&#8217;m plumb tired of that little song of
mine, &#8216;Good here&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stone stayed. Curly did not come in.</p>
<p>Cranston showed his openers and laid down his
hand. Blackwell hesitated, then raised again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reckon I&#8217;m content to trail along,&#8221; Cullison admitted,
pushing in the necessary chips.</p>
<p>Soapy rasped his stubby chin, looked sideways
at Sam and then at Blackwell, and abruptly shaved
in chips enough to call the raise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cards?&#8221; asked Curly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll play these,&#8221; Blackwell announced.</p>
<p>Sam called for two and Stone one.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>Blackwell raised. Sam, grumbling, stayed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Might as well see what you&#8217;ve got when I&#8217;ve
gone this far,&#8221; he gave as a reason for throwing
good money after bad.</p>
<p>Soapy took one glance at his new card and came
in with a raise.</p>
<p>Blackwell slammed his fist down on the table.
&#8220;Just my rotten luck. You&#8217;ve filled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stone smiled, then dropped his eyes to his cards.
Suddenly he started. What had happened was
plain. He had misread his hand.</p>
<p>With a cheerful laugh Blackwell raised in his
turn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lets me out,&#8221; Sam said.</p>
<p>For about a tenth of a second one could see
triumph ride in Soapy&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;Different here,&#8221; he
explained in a quiet businesslike way. All his chips
were pushed forward to the center of the table.</p>
<p>On Blackwell&#8217;s face were mapped his thoughts.
Curly saw his stodgy mind working on the problem,
studying helplessly the poker eyes of his easy placid
enemy. Was Soapy bluffing? Or had he baited a
hook for him to swallow? The faintest glimmer of
amusement drifted across the face of Stone. He
might have been a general whose plans have worked
out to suit him, waiting confidently for certain victory.
The longer the convict looked at him the
surer he was that he had been trapped.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>With an oath he laid down his hand. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
got me beat. Mine is only a jack high straight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stone put down his cards and reached for the
pot.</p>
<p>Curly laughed.</p>
<p>Blackwell whirled on him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s so condemned funny?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The things I notice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That I wouldn&#8217;t have laid down my hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Betcher ten plunks he had me beat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re on.&#8221; Curly turned to Soapy. &#8220;Object
to us seeing your hand?&#8221;</p>
<p>Stone was counting his chips. He smiled. &#8220;It
ain&#8217;t poker, but go ahead. Satisfy yourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You turn the cards,&#8221; Flandrau said.</p>
<p>A king of diamonds showed first, then a ten-spot
and a six-spot of the same suit.</p>
<p>&#8220;A flush,&#8221; exulted Blackwell.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got just one more ten left, but it says you&#8217;re
wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>The words were not out of Curly&#8217;s mouth before
the other had taken the bet. Soapy looked at
Flandrau with a new interest. Perhaps this boy
was not such a youth as he had first seemed.</p>
<p>The fourth card turned was a king of hearts, the
last a six of spades. Stone had had two pair to
go on and had not bettered at the draw.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>Blackwell tossed down two bills and went away
furious.</p>
<p>That night was like a good many that followed.
Sam was at an impressionable age, inclined to be led
by any man whom he admired. Curly knew that
he could gain no influence over him by preaching.
He had to live the rough-and-tumble life of these
men who dwelt beyond the pale of the law, to excel
them at the very things of which they boasted. But
in one respect he held himself apart. While he was
at the horse ranch he did not touch a drop of liquor.</p>
<p>Laura London&#8217;s letter was not delivered until
the second day, for, though she had not told her
messenger to give it to Sam when he was alone,
Curly guessed this would be better. The two young
men had ridden down to Big Tree spring to get
quail for supper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Letter for you from a young lady,&#8221; Flandrau
said, and handed it to Cullison.</p>
<p>Sam did not read his note at once, but put it in
his pocket carelessly, as if it had been an advertisement.
They lay down in the bushes about twenty
yards apart, close to the hole where the birds flew
every evening to water. Hidden by the mesquite,
Sam ran over his letter two or three times while
he was waiting. It was such a message as any
brave-hearted, impulsive girl might send to the man
she loved when he seemed to her to walk in danger.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
Cullison loved her for the interest she took in him,
even while he ridiculed her fears.</p>
<p>Presently the quails came by hundreds on a bee-line
for the water hole. They shot as many as
they needed, but no more, for neither of them cared
to kill for pleasure.</p>
<p>As they rode back to the ranch, Curly mentioned
that he had seen Sam&#8217;s people a day or two before.</p>
<p>Cullison asked no questions, but he listened intently
while the other told the story of his first
rustling and of how Miss Kate and her father had
stood by him in his trouble. The dusk was settling
over the hills by this time, so that they could
not see each other&#8217;s faces clearly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had folks like you have, the salt of the
earth, and they were worrying their hearts out
about me, seems to me I&#8217;d quit helling around and
go back to them,&#8221; Curly concluded.</p>
<p>&#8220;The old man sent you to tell me that, did he?&#8221;
Hard and bitter came the voice of the young man
out of the growing darkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he didn&#8217;t. He doesn&#8217;t know I&#8217;m here. But
he and your sister have done more for me than I
ever can pay. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m telling you this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam answered gruffly, as a man does when he is
moved, &#8220;Much obliged, Curly, but I reckon I can
look out for myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what I thought, and in September I have to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
go to the penitentiary. Now I have mortgaged it
away, my liberty seems awful good to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get off likely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a chance. They&#8217;ve got me cinched. But
with you it&#8217;s different. You haven&#8217;t fooled away
your chance yet. There&#8217;s nothing to this sort of
life. The bunch up here is no good. Soapy don&#8217;t
mean right by you, or by any young fellow he
trails with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not listen to anything against Soapy. He
took me in when my own father turned against
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To get back at your father for sending him up
the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right. He has been a good friend to
me. I&#8217;m not going to throw him down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would it be throwing him down to go back to
your people?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it would. We&#8217;ve got plans. Soapy is relying
on me. No matter what they are, but I&#8217;m
not going to lie down on him. And I&#8217;m not going
back to the old man. He told me he was through
with me. Once is a-plenty. I&#8217;m not begging him
to take me back, not on your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Curly dropped the matter. To urge him further
would only make the boy more set in his decision.
But as the days passed he kept one thing
in his mind, not to miss any chance to win his
friendship. They rode together a good deal, and
Flandrau found that Sam liked to hear him talk
about the Circle C and its affairs. But often he
was discouraged, for he made no progress in weaning
him from his loyalty to Stone. The latter was
a hero to him, and gradually he was filling him
with wrong ideas, encouraging him the while to
drink a great deal. That the man had some definite
purpose Curly was sure. What it was he meant
to find out.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he played his part of a wild young
cowpuncher ready for any mischief, but beneath his
obtuse good humor Flandrau covered a vigilant
wariness. Soapy held all the good cards now, but
if he stayed in the game some of them would come
to him. Then he would show Mr. Stone whether
he would have everything his own way.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>A REHEARSED QUARREL</h3>
</div>

<p>Because he could not persuade him to join in
their drinking bouts, Stone nicknamed Curly the
good bad man.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the prize tough in Arizona, only he&#8217;s promised
his ma not to look on the wine when it is red,&#8221;
Blackwell sneered.</p>
<p>Flandrau smiled amiably, and retorted as best he
could. It was his cue not to take offence unless
it were necessary.</p>
<p>It was perhaps on account of this good nature
that Blackwell made a mistake. He picked on the
young man to be the butt of his coarse pleasantries.
Day after day he pointed his jeers at Curly, who
continued to grin as if he did not care.</p>
<p>When the worm turned, it happened that they
were all sitting on the porch. Curly was sewing a
broken stirrup leather, Blackwell had a quirt in his
hand, and from time to time flicked it at the
back of his victim. Twice the lash stung, not hard,
but with pepper enough to hurt. Each time the
young man asked him to stop.</p>
<p>Blackwell snapped the quirt once too often.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
When he picked himself out of the dust five seconds
later, he was the maddest man in Arizona. Like a
bull he lowered his head and rushed. Curly sidestepped
and lashed out hard with his left.</p>
<p>The convict whirled, shook the hair out of his
eyes, and charged again. It was a sledge-hammer
bout, with no rules except to hit the other man
often and hard. Twice Curly went down from
chance blows, but each time he rolled away and
got to his feet before his heavy foe could close
with him. Blackwell had no science. His arms
went like flails. Though by sheer strength he kept
Flandrau backing, the latter hit cleaner and with
more punishing effect.</p>
<p>Curly watched his chance, dodged a wild swing,
and threw himself forward hard with his shoulder
against the chest of the convict. The man staggered
back, tripped on the lowest step of the porch,
and went down hard. The fall knocked the breath
out of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Had enough?&#8221; demanded Curly.</p>
<p>For answer Blackwell bit his thumb savagely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since you like it so well, have another taste.&#8221;
Curly, now thoroughly angry, sent a short-arm jolt
to the mouth.</p>
<p>The man underneath tried to throw him off, but
Flandrau&#8217;s fingers found his hairy throat and tight-
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>[Transcriber&#8217;s Note: the last line printed in the preceeding
paragraph was &#8220;tight-&#8221; and that was at a page break. The
continuation was not printed at the top of the following page.
From the context, &#8220;tightened&#8221; is likely the completed word.]</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re killing me,&#8221; the convict gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Y-yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly stepped back quickly, ready either for a
knife or a gun-play. Blackwell got to his feet, and
glared at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;A man is like a watermelon; you can&#8217;t most
generally tell how good he is till you thump him,&#8221;
Sam chuckled.</p>
<p>Cranston laughed. &#8220;Curly was not so ripe for
picking as you figured, Lute. If you&#8217;d asked me,
I could a-told you to put in yore spare time letting
him alone. But a fellow has to buy his own experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>The victor offered his hand to Blackwell. &#8220;I had
a little luck. We&#8217;ll call it quits if you say so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I stumbled over the step,&#8221; the beaten man
snarled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. I had all the luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looked to me like you were making yore own
luck, kid,&#8221; Bad Bill differed.</p>
<p>The paroled convict went into the house, swearing
to get even. His face was livid with fury.</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t think a little thing like a whaling
given fair and square would make a man hold a
grudge. My system has absorbed se-ve-real without
doing it any harm.&#8221; Sam stooped to inspect
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
a rapidly discoloring eye. &#8220;Say, Curly, he hung
a peach of a lamp on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soapy made no comment in words, but he looked
at Flandrau with a new respect. For the first time
a doubt as to the wisdom of letting him stay at
the ranch crossed his mind.</p>
<p>His suspicion was justified. Curly had been living
on the edge of a secret for weeks. Mystery
was in the air. More than once he had turned a
corner to find the other four whispering over something.
The group had disintegrated at once with
a casual indifference that did not deceive. Occasionally
a man had ridden into the yard late at
night for private talk with Stone, and Curly was
morally certain that the man was the little cowpuncher
Dutch of the Circle C.</p>
<p>Through it all Curly wore a manner of open confidence.
The furtive whisperings did not appear to
arouse his curiosity, nor did he intercept any of the
knowing looks that sometimes were exchanged.
But all the time his brain was busy with questions.
What were they up to? What was it they had
planned?</p>
<p>Stone and Blackwell rode away one morning.
To Curly the word was given that they were going
to Mesa. Four days later Soapy returned alone.
Lute had found a job, he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That a paper sticking out of your pocket?&#8221;
Flandrau asked.</p>
<p>Soapy, still astride his horse, tossed the <i>Saguache
Sentinel</i> to him as he turned toward the stable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lie number one nailed,&#8221; Curly said to himself.
&#8220;How came he with a Saguache paper if he&#8217;s been
to Mesa?&#8221;</p>
<p>Caught between the folds of the paper was a
railroad time table. It was a schedule of the trains
of the Texas, Arizona &amp; Pacific for July. This
was the twenty-ninth of June. Certainly Soapy
had lost no time getting the new folder as soon as
it was issued. Why? He might be going traveling.
If so, what had that to do with the mystery
agitating him and his friends?</p>
<p>Curly turned the pages idly till a penciled marking
caught his eye. Under Number 4&#8217;s time was
scrawled, just below Saguache, the word Tin Cup,
and opposite it the figures 10:19. The express
was due to leave Saguache at 9:57 in the evening.
From there it pushed up to the divide and slid
down with air brakes set to Tin Cup three thousand
feet lower. Soapy could not want to catch the
train fifteen miles the other side of Saguache. But
this note on the margin showed that he was interested
in the time it reached the water tank.
There must be a reason for it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>Stone came back hurriedly from the corral, to
find Curly absorbed in the Sentinel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seen anything of a railroad folder? I must
a-dropped it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was stuck in the paper. I notice there&#8217;s liable
to be trouble between Fendrick and the cattle interests
over his sheep,&#8221; the reader answered casually.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep. Between Fendrick and Cullison, anyhow.&#8221;
Stone had reclaimed and pocketed his time
table.</p>
<p>Incidentally Flandrau&#8217;s doubt had been converted
into a lively suspicion. Presently he took a gun,
and strolled off to shoot birds. What he really
wanted was to be alone so that he could think the
matter over. Coming home in the dusk, he saw
Stone and young Cullison with their heads together
down by the corral. Curious to see how long this
earnest talk would last, Curly sat down on a rock,
and watched them, himself unobserved. They appeared
to be rehearsing some kind of a scene, of
which Soapy was stage director.</p>
<p>The man on the rock smiled grimly. &#8220;They&#8217;re
having a quarrel, looks like.... Now the
kid&#8217;s telling Soapy to go to Guinea, and Soapy&#8217;s
pawing around mad as a bull moose. It&#8217;s all a
play. They don&#8217;t mean it. But why? I reckon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
this dress rehearsal ain&#8217;t for the calves in the corral.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly&#8217;s mind was so full of guesses that his
poker was not up to par that night. About daybreak
he began to see his way into the maze. His
first gleam of light was when a row started between
Soapy and Cullison. Before anyone could
say a word to stop them they were going through
with that identical corral quarrel.</p>
<p>Flandrau knew now they had been preparing
it for his benefit. Cranston chipped in against Sam,
and to keep up appearances Curly backed the boy.
The quarrel grew furious. At last Sam drove his
fist down on the table and said he was through with
the outfit and was going back to Saguache.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Yo tambien</i>,&#8221; agreed Curly. &#8220;Not that I&#8217;ve
got anything against the horse ranch. That ain&#8217;t
it. But I&#8217;m sure pining for to bust the bank at
Bronson&#8217;s.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got forty plunks burning my jeans. I&#8217;ve got
to separate myself from it or make my roll a thousand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The end of it was that both Sam and Curly went
down to the corral and saddled their ponies. To
the last the conspirators played up to their parts.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Damned good riddance,&#8221; Stone called after
them as they rode away.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I find out I&#8217;m doing business with four-flushers,
I quit them cold,&#8221; Sam called back
angrily.</p>
<p>Curly was amused. He wanted to tell his friend
that they had pulled off their little play very well.
But he did not.</p>
<p>Still according to program, Sam sulked for the
first few miles of their journey. But before they
reached the Bar 99 he grew sunny again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to have a talk with Laura while I&#8217;m
so near,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that will be fine. From the way the old
man talked when I was there, I expect he&#8217;ll kill
the fatted yearling for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t figure on including the old man in my
call. What&#8217;s the use of having a friend along if
you don&#8217;t use him? You drift in ... just
happen along, you know. I&#8217;ll stay in the scrub
pines up here. If the old man is absent scenery,
you wave your bandanna real industrious. If he is
at home, give Laura the tip and she&#8217;ll know where
to find me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The owner of the ranch, as it happened, was cutting
trail over by Agua Caliente.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to see him very bad, Mr. Flandrau?&#8221;
asked Miss Laura demurely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My friends call me Curly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I meant to say Curly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I thought. No, I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve
lost Mr. London.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You inquired for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmp! That&#8217;s different. When I used to come
home from the swimming hole contrary to orders,
I used to ask where Dad was, but I didn&#8217;t want
to see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. Did you just come down from the horse
ranch?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve guessed it right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m sorry I can&#8217;t ask you to &#8217;light. Dad&#8217;s
orders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got lots of respect for his orders, haven&#8217;t
you?&#8221; he derided.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have.&#8221; She could not quite make up her
mind whether to laugh or become indignant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s no use trying to tell you the news
from the ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>A smile dimpled her cheeks and bubbled in her
eyes. &#8220;If you should tell me, I suppose I couldn&#8217;t
help hearing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m trying to figure out my duty. Maybe
I oughtn&#8217;t to tempt you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;While you&#8217;re making up your mind, I&#8217;ll run
back into the kitchen and look at the pies in the
oven.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>Curly swung from the saddle, and tossed the
bridle rein to the ground. He followed her into
the house. She was taking an apple pie from the
oven, but took time to be saucy over her shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not allowed to invite you into the house,
sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything in the by-laws about me inviting myself
in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, that wasn&#8217;t mentioned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything in them about you meeting one of the
lads from the horse ranch up on the hillside where
it is neutral ground?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Sam come with you?&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who said anything about Sam?&#8221;</p>
<p>Glints of excitement danced in the brown pupils
of her eyes. &#8220;He&#8217;s here. Oh, I know he&#8217;s here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do I get for bringing good news?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say it was good news.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sho! Your big eyes are shouting it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was that the news from the horse ranch?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s part of it, but there is more. Sam and
Curly are on their way to Saguache to spend the
Fourth of July. Sam is going for another reason,
but I&#8217;m not sure yet what it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something doing I don&#8217;t <i>savez</i>, some
big deal on foot that&#8217;s not on the level. Sam is in
it up to the hocks. To throw me off the scent they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
fixed up a quarrel among them. Sam is supposed
to be quitting Soapy&#8217;s outfit for good. But I know
better.&#8221;</p>
<p>White to the lips, she faced him bravely. &#8220;What
sort of trouble is he leading Sam into?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a kind of a notion. But it won&#8217;t bear
talking about yet. Don&#8217;t you worry, little girl.
I&#8217;m going to stand by Sam. And don&#8217;t tell him
what I&#8217;ve told you, unless you want to spoil my
chance of helping him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t,&#8221; she promised; then added, with quick
eagerness: &#8220;Maybe I can help you. I&#8217;m going
down to Saguache to visit on the fourth. I&#8217;m to
be there two weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll look you up. Trouble is that Sam is hell
bent on ruining himself. Seems to think Soapy is
his best friend. If we could show him different
things might work out all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>While she climbed the hill to Sam, Curly watered
his horse and smoked a cigarette. He was not hired
to chaperone lovers. Therefore, it took him three-quarters
of an hour to reach the scrub pine belt on
the edge of the park.</p>
<p>At once he saw that they had been having a
quarrel. The girl&#8217;s eyes were red, and she was
still dabbing at them with her handkerchief when
he came whistling along. Sam looked discouraged,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
but stubborn. Very plainly they had been disagreeing
about his line of conduct.</p>
<p>The two young men took the trail again. The
moroseness of Sam was real and not affected this
time. He had flared up because the girl could not
let him alone about his friendship for Soapy Stone.
In his heart the boy knew he was wrong, that he
was moving fast in the wrong direction. But his
pride would neither let him confess it or go back
on his word to the men with whom he had been
living.</p>
<p>About noon the next day they reached Saguache.
After they had eaten, Curly strolled off by himself
to the depot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gimme a ticket to Tin Cup for this evening. I
want to go by the express,&#8221; he told the agent.</p>
<p>The man looked at him and grinned. &#8220;I saw
you at Mesa in the bucking broncho doings last
year, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you did and maybe you didn&#8217;t. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly stay with the bad bronchs to a
fare-you-well. If I&#8217;d been judge you&#8217;d a-had first
place, Mr. Flandrau.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Much obliged. And now you&#8217;ve identified me
sufficient, how about that ticket?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was coming to that. Sure you can get a
ticket. Good on any train. You&#8217;re so darned active,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
maybe you could get off Number 4 when she
is fogging along sixty miles per. But most folks
couldn&#8217;t, not with any comfort.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning that the Flyer doesn&#8217;t stop?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at Tin Cup.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have to take the afternoon train then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon.&#8221; He punched a ticket and shoved it
through the window toward Curly. &#8220;Sixty-five
cents, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flandrau paid for and pocketed the ticket he
did not intend to use. He had found out what he
wanted to know. The express did not stop at Tin
Cup. Why, then, had Soapy marked the time of
its arrival there? He was beginning to guess the
reason. But he would have to do more than
guess.</p>
<p>Curly walked back to the business section from
the depot. Already the town was gay with banners
in preparation for the Fourth. On the program
were broncho-busting, roping, Indian dances, races,
and other frontier events. Already visitors were
gathering for the festivities. Saguache, wide open
for the occasion, was already brisk with an assorted
population of many races. Mexicans, Chinese,
Indians of various tribes brushed shoulders
with miners, tourists and cattlemen. Inside the saloons
faro, chuckaluck and roulette attracted each
its devotees.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>Flandrau sauntered back to the hotel on the lookout
for Sam. He was not there, but waiting for
him was a boy with a note for the gentleman in
Number 311.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kid looking for you,&#8221; the clerk called to the
cowpuncher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you Mr. Soapy Stone&#8217;s friend, the one just
down from Dead Cow creek?&#8221; asked the boy.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, the answer was open to debate.
But Curly nodded and took the note.</p>
<p>This was what he read:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>Sam, come to Chalkeye&#8217;s place soon as
you get this. There we will talk over the
business.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>You Know Who</span>.</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>Though he did not know who, Curly thought he
could give a pretty good guess both as to the author
and the business that needed talking over.</p>
<p>Through the open door of the hotel he saw Sam
approaching. Quickly he sealed the flap of the envelope
again, and held it pressed against his fingers
while he waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;A letter for you, Sam.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cullison tore open the envelope and read the
note.</p>
<p>&#8220;A friend of mine has come to town and wants
to see me,&#8221; he explained.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>To help out his bluff, Curly sprang the feeble-minded
jest on him. &#8220;Blonde or brunette?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no lady&#8217;s man,&#8221; Sam protested, content to
let the other follow a wrong scent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure not. It never is a lady,&#8221; Flandrau called
after him as he departed.</p>
<p>But Sam had no more than turned the corner
before Curly was out of a side door and cutting
through an alley toward Chalkeye&#8217;s place. Reaching
the back door of the saloon, he opened it a few
inches and peered in. A minute later Sam opened
the front screen and asked a question of the man
in the apron. The bartender gave a jerk of his
thumb. Sam walked toward the rear and turned
in at the second private booth.</p>
<p>Curly slipped forward quietly, and passed unobserved
into the third stall. The wall which divided
one room from another was of pine boarding
and did not reach the ceiling. As the eavesdropper
slid to a seat a phonograph in front began the Merry
Widow waltz. Noiselessly Flandrau stood on the
cushioned bench with his ear close to the top of
the dividing wall. He could hear a murmur of
voices but could not make out a word. The record
on the instrument wheezed to silence, but immediately
a rag-time tune followed.</p>
<p>Presently the music died away. Flattened against
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
the wall, his attention strained to the utmost, Curly
began to catch words and phrases of the low-voiced
speakers in the next compartment. His position
was perilous in the extreme, but he would not leave
now until he had found out what he wanted to
know.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>EAVESDROPPING</h3>
</div>

<p>Out of the murmur of voices came one that Curly
recognized as that of Soapy Stone, alias You Know
Who.</p>
<p>&#8220; ... then you&#8217;ll take the 9:57, Sam....&#8221;</p>
<p>After more whispering, &#8220;Yep, soon as you hear
the first shot ... cover the passengers....&#8221;</p>
<p>The listener lost what followed. Once he thought
he heard the name Tin Cup, but he could not be
sure. Presently another fragment drifted to him.
&#8220;...make our getaway and cache the plunder....&#8221;</p>
<p>The phonograph lifted up its voice again. This
time it was &#8220;I love a lassie.&#8221; Before the song was
finished there came the sound of shuffling feet. One
of the men in the next stall was leaving. Curly
could not tell which one, nor did he dare look over
the top of the partition to find out. He was playing
safe. This adventure had caught him so unexpectedly
that he had not found time to run back
to his room for his six-gun. What would happen
to him if he were caught listening was not a matter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
of doubt. Soapy would pump lead into him till he
quit kicking, slap a saddle on a broncho, and light
out for the Sonora line.</p>
<p>As the phonograph finished unexpectedly&mdash;someone
had evidently interrupted the record&mdash;the fragment
of a sentence seemed to jump at Curly.</p>
<p>&#8220; ... so the kid will get his in the row.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the voice of Soapy, raised slightly to make
itself heard above the music.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take care,&#8221; another voice replied, and Flandrau
would have sworn that this belonged to Blackwell.</p>
<p>Stone, who had been sitting on the other side of
the table, moved close to the paroled convict. Between
him and Curly there was only the thickness
of a plank. The young man was afraid that the
knocking of his heart could be heard.</p>
<p>&#8220; ... don&#8217;t like it,&#8221; Blackwell was objecting
sullenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Makes it safe for us. Besides&#8221;&mdash;Stone&#8217;s voice
grated like steel rasping steel, every word distinct
though very low&mdash;&#8220;I swore to pay off Luck Cullison,
and by God! I&#8217;m going to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone will hear you if you ain&#8217;t careful,&#8221; the
convict protested anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be an old woman, Lute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220; ... if you can do it safe. I owe Luck Cullison
much as you do, but....&#8221;</p>
<p>Again they fell to whispers. The next word that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
came to Curly clearly was his own name. But it
was quite a minute before he gathered what they
were saying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Luck Cullison went his bail. I learnt it this
mo&#8217;ning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The son-of-a-gun. It&#8217;s a cinch he&#8217;s a spy. And
me wanting you to let him in so&#8217;s he could hold
the sack instead of Sam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Knew it wouldn&#8217;t do, Lute. He&#8217;s smart as a
whip.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reckon he knows anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I thought he did&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep your shirt on, Lute. He don&#8217;t know a
thing. And you get revenge on him all right. Sam
will run with him and his friends while he&#8217;s here.
Consequence is, when they find the kid where we
leave him they&#8217;ll sure guess Curly for one of his
pardners. Tell you his ticket is good as bought
to Yuma. He&#8217;s a horse thief. Why shouldn&#8217;t he
be a train robber, too. That&#8217;s how a jury will
argue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blackwell grumbled something under his breath.</p>
<p>Stone&#8217;s voice grated harshly. &#8220;Me too. If he
crosses my trail I&#8217;m liable to spoil his hide before
court meets. No man alive can play me for a sucker
and throw me down. Not Soapy Stone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more the voices ran together indistinctly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
It was not till Blackwell suggested that they go
get a drink that Curly understood anything more
of what was being said.</p>
<p>The outlaws passed out of the little room and
strolled forward to the bar.</p>
<p>Curly had heard more than he had expected to.
Moreover, as he congratulated himself, his luck had
stood up fine. Nobody in the sunburnt territory
felt happier than he did that minute when he struck
the good fresh air of the alley and knew that he
had won through his hazardous adventure alive.</p>
<p>The first thing that Flandrau did was to walk
toward the outskirts of the town where he could
think it out by himself. But in this little old planet
events do not always occur as a man plans them.
Before he reached Arroyo street Curly came plump
against his old range-mate Slats Davis.</p>
<p>The assistant foreman of the Hashknife nodded
as he passed. He had helped Curly escape less than
a month before, but he did not intend to stay friendly
with a rustler.</p>
<p>Flandrau caught him by the arm. &#8220;Hello, Slats.
You&#8217;re the man I want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty busy to-day,&#8221; Davis answered stiffly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forget it. This is more important.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along and take a walk. I got something
to tell you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you tell it here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t going to, anyhow. Come along. I ain&#8217;t
got smallpox.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reluctantly Davis fell in beside him. &#8220;All right.
Cut it short. I&#8217;ve got to see a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll have to wait.&#8221; Curly could not help chuckling
to himself at the evident embarrassment of the
other. The impish impulse to &#8220;devil&#8221; him had its
way. &#8220;You&#8217;re a man of experience, Slats. Ever
hold up a train?&#8221;</p>
<p>The foreman showed plainly his disgust at this
foolishness. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t you sense enough ever to
be serious, Curly? You&#8217;re not a kid any more. In
age you&#8217;re a grown man. But how do you act?
Talk like that don&#8217;t do you any good. You&#8217;re in
trouble good and deep. Folks have got their eyes
on you. Now is the time to show them you have
quit all that hell raising you have been so busy
at.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He sure is going good this mo&#8217;ning,&#8221; Curly
drawled confidentially to the scenery. &#8220;You would
never guess, would you, that him and me had raised
that crop in couples?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, too. I&#8217;m no sky pilot. But I
know when to quit. Seemingly you don&#8217;t. I hear
you&#8217;ve been up at Stone&#8217;s horse ranch. I want to
tell you that won&#8217;t do you any good if it gets out.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Never was satisfied till I had rounded up all
the trouble in sight. That&#8217;s why I mentioned this
train robbery. Some of my friends are aiming to
hold up one shortly. If you&#8217;d like to get in I&#8217;ll
say a good word for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davis threw at him a look that drenched like ice
water. &#8220;I expect you and me are traveling different
trails these days, Curly. You don&#8217;t mean it
of course, but the point is I&#8217;m not going to joke
with you along that line. Understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wrong guess, old hoss. I do mean it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davis stopped in his tracks. &#8220;Then you&#8217;ve said
too much to me. We&#8217;ll part right here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It takes two to agree to that, Slats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where you&#8217;re wrong. One is enough.
We used to be good friends, but those days are
past. None of us can keep a man from being a
durned fool if he wants to be one. Nor a scoundrel.
You&#8217;ve got the bit in your teeth and I reckon you&#8217;ll
go till there is a smash. But you better understand
this. When you choose Soapy Stone&#8217;s, crowd to
run with that cuts out me and other decent folks.
If they have sent you here to get me mixed up in
their deviltry you go back and tell them there&#8217;s
nothing doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t have a thing to do with them. Is that
it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not till the call comes for citizens to get together
and run them out of the country. Or to put
them behind bars. Or to string them to a cottonwood.
Then I&#8217;ll be on the job.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stood there quiet and easy, the look in his
steady eyes piercing Curly&#8217;s ironic smile as a summer
sun does mackerel clouds in a clear sky. Not
many men would have had the courage to send
that message to Soapy and his outfit. For Stone
was not only a man killer, but a mean one at that.
Since he had come back from the penitentiary he
had been lying pretty low, but he brought down
from the old days a record that chilled the blood.</p>
<p>Curly sloughed his foolishness and came to the
point.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re on, Slats. I&#8217;m making that call to you
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The eyes of the two men fastened. Those of
Flandrau had quit dancing and were steady as the
sun in a blue sky. Surprise, doubt, wonder, relief
filled in turn the face of the other man.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m listening, Curly.&#8221;</p>
<p>His friend told him the whole story from the
beginning, just as he had been used to do in the
old days. And Davis heard it without a word,
taking the tale in quietly with a grim look settling,
on his face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So he aims to play traitor to young Cullison.
The thing is damnable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He means to shut Sam&#8217;s mouth for good and
all. That is what he has been playing for from
the start, to get even with Luck. He and his gang
will get away with the haul and they will leave Sam
dead on the scene of the hold-up. There will be
some shooting, and it will be figured the boy was
hit by one of the train crew. Nothing could be
easier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it worked out right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t help working out right. That&#8217;s why
Soapy didn&#8217;t let me in on the proposition. To get
rid of one would be no great trouble, but two&mdash;well,
that&#8217;s different. Besides, I could tell he was
not sure of me. Now he aims to put me on the
stand and prove by me that Sam and he had a
quarrel and parted company mighty sore at each
other hardly a week before the hold-up. He&#8217;ll have
an alibi too to show he couldn&#8217;t have been in it.
You&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t think a white man could take a
revenge like that on his enemy. It&#8217;s an awful thing
to do in cold blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Soapy is no white man. He&#8217;s a wolf. See how
slick his scheme is. At one flip of the cards he kills
the kid and damns his reputation. He scores Cullison
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
and he snuffs out Sam, who had had the luck
to win the girl Soapy fancies. The boy gets his
and the girl is shown she can&#8217;t love another man
than Stone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever hear the story of French Dan?&#8221; asked
Slats.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to know the right of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Soapy and Dan trained together in them days
and went through a lot of meanness as side pardners.
One day the Arivaca stage was held up by
two men and the driver killed. In the scrap one
of the men had his mask torn off. It was French
Dan. Well, the outlaws had been too damned busy.
Folks woke up and the hills were sprinkled with
posses. They ran the fellows down and hunted
them from place to place. Two&mdash;three times they
almost nailed them. Shots were exchanged. A
horse of one of the fugitives was killed and they
could not get another. Finally one dark night the
outlaws were surrounded. The posse lay down in
the zacaton and waited for morning. In the night
one of them heard a faint sound like the popping
of a cork. When mo&#8217;ning broke the hunters crept
forward through the thick grass. Guess what they
found.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly&#8217;s answer was prompt. &#8220;Gimme a harder
one. There were two men and only one horse. The
only chance was to slip through the line before day
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
arrived. My guess is that they found French Dan
with a little round hole in his skull&mdash;<i>and that the
bullet making it had gone in from behind</i>. My
guess also is that the posse didn&#8217;t find the horse
and the other man, just a trail through the zacaton
back into the hills.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to the head of the class. There was one
man too many in that thicket for the horse. French
Dan&#8217;s pardner was afraid they might not agree
about who was to have the bronch for a swift getaway.
So he took no chances. There&#8217;s only one
man alive to-day can swear that Soapy was the
man with French Dan lying in the zacaton. And
he&#8217;ll never tell, because he pumped the bullet into
his friend. But one thing is sure. Soapy disappeared
from Arizona for nearly two years. You
can pick any reason you like for his going. That is
the one I choose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Same here. And the man that would shoot one
partner in the back would shoot another if he had
good reasons. By his way of it Soapy has reasons
a-plenty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m satisfied that is his game. Question is how
to block it. Will you go to the sheriff?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Bolt would fall down on it. First off, he
would not believe the story because I&#8217;m a rustler
myself. Soapy and his friends voted for Bolt. He
would go to them, listen to their story, prove part
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
of it by me, and turn them loose for lack of evidence.
Sam would go back to Dead Cow with
them, and Stone would weave another web for the
kid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got it about right,&#8221; Slats admitted.
&#8220;How about warning Sam?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No use. He would go straight to Soapy with
it, and his dear friend would persuade him it was
just a yarn cooked up to get him to throw down
the only genuwine straight-up pal he ever had.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cullison then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re getting warm. I&#8217;ve had that notion myself.
The point is, would he be willing to wait
and let Soapy play his hand out till we called?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You would have to guarantee his boy would be
safe meanwhile.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two of us would have to watch him day and
night without Sam knowing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Count me in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is where we hit heavy traveling, Slats.
For we don&#8217;t know when the thing is going to be
pulled off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to be ready. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Happen to know whether Dick Maloney is here
for the show?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Saw him this mo&#8217;ning. Luck is here too, him
and his girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good. We&#8217;ve got to have a talk with them,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
and it has to be on the q.t. You go back to town
and find Dick. Tell him to meet us at the Del
Mar, where Luck always puts up. Find out the
number of Cullison&#8217;s room and make an appointment.
I&#8217;ll be on El Molino street all mo&#8217;ning off
and on. When you find out pass me without stopping,
but tell me when we are to meet and just
where.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly gave Slats a quarter of an hour before
sauntering back to town. As he was passing the
Silver Dollar saloon a voice called him. Stone and
Blackwell were standing in the door. Flandrau
stopped.</p>
<p>Soapy&#8217;s deep-set eyes blazed at him. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t
tell me it was Luck Cullison went bail for you,
Curly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t ask me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you and him are thick, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve met him once, if that&#8217;s being thick. That
time I shot him up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Funny. And then he went bail for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I wonder why.&#8221;</p>
<p>The eyes of the man had narrowed to red slits.
His head had shot forward on his shoulders as
that of a snake does. Curly would have given a
good deal just then for the revolver lying on the
bed of his room. For it was plain trouble was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
in sight. The desperado had been drinking heavily
and was ready to do murder.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy to explain, Soapy. I shot him because
I was driven to it. He&#8217;s too much of a man
to bear a grudge for what I couldn&#8217;t help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it, is it? Does that explain why he dug
up good money to turn loose a horse thief?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I told you why, you would not understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s hear you try.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did it because I was young, just as Sam is;
and because he figured that some day Sam might
need a friend, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a liar. He did it because you promised
to sneak up to my ranch and spy on us. That&#8217;s why
he did it.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the last word his gun jumped into sight.
That he was lashing himself into a fury was plain.
Presently his rage would end in a tragedy.</p>
<p>Given a chance, Curly would have run for it.
But Soapy was a dead shot. Of a sudden the anger
in the boy boiled up over the fear. In two jumps
he covered the ground and jammed his face close
to the cold rim of the blue steel barrel.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not heeled. Shoot and be damned, you
coward. And with my last breath I&#8217;ll tell you that
you&#8217;re a liar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flandrau had called his bluff, though he had not
meant it as one. A dozen men were in sight and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
were watching. They had heard the young man
tell Stone he was not armed. Public opinion would
hold him to account if he shot Curly down in cold
blood. He hung there undecided, breathing fast,
his jaw clamped tightly.</p>
<p>The lad hammered home his defiance. &#8220;Drop
that gun, you four-flusher, and I&#8217;ll whale you till
you can&#8217;t stand. <i>Sabe?</i> Call yourself a bad man,
do you? Time I&#8217;m through with you there will
be one tame wolf crawling back to Dead Cow with
its tail between its legs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The taunt diverted his mind, just as Curly had
hoped it would. He thrust the revolver back into
the holster and reached for his foe.</p>
<p>Then everybody, hitherto paralyzed by the sight
of a deadly weapon, woke up and took a hand.
They dragged the two men apart. Curly was thrust
into a barber shop on the other side of the street
and Stone was dragged back into the Silver Dollar.</p>
<p>In two minutes Flandrau had made himself
famous, for he was a marked man. The last words
of the straggling desperado had been that he would
shoot on sight. Now half a dozen talked at once.
Some advised Curly one thing, some another. He
must get out of town. He must apologize at once
to Stone. He must send a friend and explain.</p>
<p>The young man laughed grimly. &#8220;Explain nothing.
I&#8217;ve done all the explaining I&#8217;m going to.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
And I&#8217;ll not leave town either. If Soapy wants
me he&#8217;ll sure find me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be foolish, kid. He has got four notches
on that gun of his. And he&#8217;s a dead shot.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tongues of those about him galloped. Soapy
was one of these Billy-the-Kid killers, the only one
left from the old days. He could whang away at
a quarter with that sawed-off .45 of his and hit it
every crack. The sooner Curly understood that no
boy would have a chance with him the better it
would be. So the talk ran.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got you bluffed to a fare-you-well. You&#8217;re
tame enough to eat out of his hand. Didn&#8217;t Luck
Cullison go into the hills and bring him down all
alone?&#8221; Flandrau demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Luck&#8217;s another wonder. There ain&#8217;t another
man in Arizona could have done it. Leastways no
other but Bucky O&#8217;Connor.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Curly was excited, pleased with himself because
he had stood up to the bogey man of the
Southwest, and too full of strength to be afraid.</p>
<p>Maloney came into the barber shop and grinned
at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, son!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Dick!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear you and Soapy are figuring on setting
off some fireworks this Fourth.&#8221;</p>
<p>It did Curly good to see him standing there so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
easy and deliberate among the excitable town people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Soapy is doing the talking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard him; happened to be at the Silver Dollar
when they dragged him in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maloney&#8217;s eyebrows moved the least bit. His
friend understood. Together they passed out of the
back door of the shop into an alley. The others
stood back and let them go. But their eyes did
not leave Curly so long as he was in sight. Until
this thing was settled one way or the other the
young rustler would be one of the most important
men in town. Citizens would defer to him that
had never noticed him before. He carried with
him a touch of the solemnity that is allowed only
the dead or the dying.</p>
<p>Back to the hotel the two ran. When Curly
buckled on his revolver and felt it resting comfortably
against his thigh he felt a good deal better.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen Slats Davis,&#8221; Maloney explained. &#8220;He
has gone to find Luck, who is now at the Del Mar.
At least he was an hour ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Had any talk with Slats?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. He said you&#8217;d do the talking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m to wait for him on El Molino street to learn
where I&#8217;m to meet Cullison.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t do. You&#8217;d make too tempting a
target. I&#8217;ll meet him instead.&#8221;</p>
<p>That suited Curly. He was not hunting trouble
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
just now, even though he would not run away from
it. For he had serious business on hand that could
not take care of itself if Soapy should kill him.</p>
<p>Nearly an hour later Maloney appeared again.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re to go right over to the Del Mar. Second
floor, room 217. You are to go down El Molino to
Main, then follow it to the hotel, keeping on the
right hand side of the street. Slats will happen
along the other side of the street and will keep
abreast of you. Luck will walk with me behind
you. Unless I yell your name don&#8217;t pay any attention
to what is behind you. Soon as we reach the
hotel Slats will cross the road and go in by the
side door. You will follow him a few steps behind,
and we&#8217;ll bring up the rear casually as if we hadn&#8217;t
a thing to do with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re taking a heap of pains, seems to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Want to keep you from getting spoilt till September
term of court opens. Didn&#8217;t I promise Bolt
you would show up?&#8221;</p>
<p>They moved down the street as arranged. Every
time a door opened in front of him, every time a
man came out of a store or a saloon, Curly was
ready for that lightning lift of the arm followed
by a puff of smoke. The news of his coming passed
ahead of him, so that windows were crowded with
spectators. These were doomed to disappointment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
Nothing happened. The procession left behind it
the Silver Dollar, the Last Chance, Chalkeye&#8217;s Place
and Pete&#8217;s Palace.</p>
<p>Reaching the hotel first, Davis disappeared according
to program into the side door. Carly followed,
walked directly up the stairs, along the corridor,
and passed without knocking into Room 217.</p>
<p>A young woman was sitting there engaged with
some fancy work. Slender and straight, Kate Cullison
rose and gave Curly her hand. For about two
heartbeats her fingers lay cuddled in his big fist.
A strange stifling emotion took his breath.</p>
<p>Then her arm fell to her side and she was speaking
to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad has gone to meet you. We&#8217;ve heard about
what happened this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean what didn&#8217;t happen. Beats all how
far a little excitement goes in this town,&#8221; he answered,
embarrassed.</p>
<p>Her father and Maloney entered the room. Cullison
wrung his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to see you, boy. You&#8217;re in luck that convict
did not shoot you up while he had the chance.
Saguache is sure buzzing this mo&#8217;ning with the way
you stood up to him. That little play of yours will
help with the jury in September.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly thanked him for going bail.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>Luck fixed his steel-spoked eyes on him. &#8220;By
what Dick tells me you&#8217;ve more than squared that
account.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kate explained in her soft voice. &#8220;Dick told us
why you went up to Dead Cow creek.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sho! I hadn&#8217;t a thing to do, so I just ran
up there. Sam&#8217;s in town with me. We&#8217;re rooming
together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, take me to him,&#8221; Kate cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not just now, honey,&#8221; her father said gently.
&#8220;This young man came here to tell us something.
Or so I gathered from his friend Davis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flandrau told his story, or all of it that would
bear telling before a girl. He glossed over his
account of the dissipation at the horse ranch, but
he told all he knew of Laura London and her interest
in Sam. But it was when he related what
he had heard at Chalkeye&#8217;s place that the interest
grew most tense. While he was going over the plot
to destroy young Cullison there was no sound in
the room but his voice. Luck&#8217;s eyes burned like
live coals. The color faded from the face of his
daughter so that her lips were gray as cigar ash.
Yet she sat up straight and did not flinch.</p>
<p>When he had finished the owner of the Circle C
caught his hand. &#8220;You&#8217;ve done fine, boy. Not a
man in Arizona could have done it better.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>Kate said nothing in words but her dark longlashed
eyes rained thanks upon him.</p>
<p>They talked the situation over from all angles.
Always it simmered down to one result. It was
Soapy&#8217;s first play. Until he moved they could not.
They had no legal evidence except the word of
Curly. Nor did they know on what night he had
planned to pull off the hold-up. If they were to
make a complete gather of the outfit, with evidence
enough to land them in the penitentiary, it could
only be after the hold-up.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there was nothing to do but wait and
take what precautions they could against being
caught by surprise. One of these was to see that
Sam was never for an instant left unguarded either
day or night. Another was to ride to Tin Cup and
look the ground over carefully. For the present
they could do no more than watch events, attracting
no attention by any whispering together in
public.</p>
<p>Before the conference broke up Kate came in with
her protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all very well, but what about Mr. Flandrau?
He can&#8217;t stay in Saguache with that man
threatening to kill him on sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about me, Miss Kate;&#8221; and Curly
looked at her and blushed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>Her father smiled grimly. &#8220;No, I wouldn&#8217;t, Kate.
He isn&#8217;t going to be troubled by that wolf just
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t stand to reason he&#8217;d spoil all his plans
just to bump me off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he might. He forgot all about his plans
this morning. How do we know he mightn&#8217;t a
second time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry, honey. I&#8217;ve got a card up my
sleeve,&#8221; Luck promised.</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>&#8220;STICK TO YOUR SADDLE&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>The old Arizona fashion of settling a difference
of opinion with the six-gun had long fallen into
disuse, but Saguache was still close enough to the
stark primeval emotions to wait with a keen interest
for the crack of the revolver that would put
a period to the quarrel between Soapy Stone and
young Flandrau. It was known that Curly had refused
to leave town, just as it was known that
Stone and that other prison bird Blackwell were
hanging about the Last Chance and Chalkeye&#8217;s
Place drinking together morosely. It was observed
too that whenever Curly appeared in public he was
attended by friends. Sometimes it would be Maloney
and Davis, sometimes his uncle Alec Flandrau,
occasionally a couple of the Map of Texas vaqueros.</p>
<p>It chanced that &#8220;Old Man&#8221; Flandrau, drifting
into Chalkeye&#8217;s Place, found in the assembled group
the man he sought. Billie Mackenzie, grizzled
owner of the Fiddleback ranch, was with him, and
it was in the preliminary pause before drinking that
Alec made his official announcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mac, I ain&#8217;t worrying about that any. Curly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
is going to get a square deal. We&#8217;re all agreed on
that. If there&#8217;s any shooting from cover there&#8217;ll
be a lynching <i>pronto</i>. That goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flandrau, Senior, did not glance at the sullen
face of Lute Blackwell hovering in the background
but he knew perfectly well that inside of an hour
word would reach Soapy Stone that only an even
break with Curly would be allowed.</p>
<p>The day passed without a meeting between the
two. Curly grew nervous at the delay.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m as restless as a toad on a hot skillet,&#8221; he
confessed to Davis. &#8220;This thing of never knowing
what minute Soapy will send me his leaden compliments
ain&#8217;t any picnic. Wisht it was over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s drinking himself blind. Every hour is to
the good for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly shrugged. &#8220;Drunk or sober Soapy always
shoots straight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another day passed. The festivities had begun
and Curly had to be much in evidence before the
public. His friends had attempted to dissuade him
from riding in the bucking broncho contest, but
he had refused to let his name be scratched from
the list of contestants.</p>
<p>A thousand pair of eyes in the grandstand watched
the boy as he lounged against the corral fence
laughing and talking with his friends. A dozen
people were on the lookout for the approach of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
Stone. Fifty others had warned the young man
to be careful. For Saguache was with him almost
to a man.</p>
<p>Dick Maloney heard his voice called as he was
passing the grandstand, A minute later he was in
the Cullison box shaking hands with Kate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is&mdash;is there anything new?&#8221; she asked in a low
voice.</p>
<p>Her friend shook his head. &#8220;No. Soapy may
drift out here any minute now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will he&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221; Her eyes finished the question.</p>
<p>He shook his head. &#8220;Don&#8217;t know. That&#8217;s the
mischief of it. If they should meet just after Curly
finishes riding the boy won&#8217;t have a chance. His
nerves won&#8217;t be steady enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad is doing something. I don&#8217;t know what
it is. He had a meeting with a lot of cattlemen
about it&mdash;&mdash; I don&#8217;t see how that boy <i>can</i> sit
there on the fence laughing when any minute&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Curly&#8217;s game as they make &#8217;em. He&#8217;s a prince,
too. I like that boy better every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t seem to me so&mdash;&mdash;wild. But they
say he&#8217;s awfully reckless.&#8221; She said it with a visible
reluctance, as if she wanted him to deny the charge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sho! Curly needs explaining some. That&#8217;s all.
Give a dog a bad name and hang him. That saying
is as straight as the trail of a thirsty cow. The
kid got off wrong foot first, and before he&#8217;d hardly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
took to shaving respectable folks were hunting the
dictionary to find bad names to throw at him. He
was a reprobate and no account. Citizens that
differed on everything else was unanimous about
that. Mothers kinder herded their young folks in
a corral when he slung his smile their way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221; she persisted. &#8220;What had he done?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gambled his wages, and drank some, and, beat
up Pete Schiff, and shot the lights out of the Legal
Tender saloon. That&#8217;s about all at first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t it enough?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most folks thought so. So when Curly bumped
into them keep-off-the-grass signs parents put up
for him he had to prove they were justified. That&#8217;s
the way a kid acts. Half the bad men are only
coltish cowpunchers gone wrong through rotten
whiskey and luck breaking bad for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Soapy that kind?&#8221; she asked, but not because
she did not know the answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the other kind, bad at the heart. But Curly
was just a kid crazy with the heat when he made
that fool play of rustling horses.&#8221;</p>
<p>A lad made his way to them with a note. Kate
read it and turned to Dick. Her eyes were shining
happily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got news from Dad. It&#8217;s all right. Soapy
Stone has left town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A dozen of the big cattlemen signed a note and
sent it to Stone. They told him that if he touched
Curly he would never leave town alive. He was
given word to get out of town at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maloney slapped his hand joyously on his thigh.
&#8220;Fine! Might a-known Luck would find a way
out. I tell you this thing has been worying me.
Some of us wanted to take it off Curly&#8217;s hands,
but he wouldn&#8217;t have it. He&#8217;s a man from the
ground up, Curly is. But your father found a way
to butt in all right. Soapy couldn&#8217;t stand
out against the big ranchmen when they got
together and meant business. He had to pull his
freight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me tell him the good news, Dick,&#8221; she said,
eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. I&#8217;ll send him right up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bronzed almost to a coffee brown, with the lean
lithe grace of youth garbed in the picturesque
regalia of the <i>vaquero</i>, Flandrau was a taking
enough picture to hold the roving eye of any girl.
A good many centered upon him now, as he sauntered
forward toward the Cullison box cool and
easy and debonair. More than one pulse quickened
at sight of him, for his gallantry, his peril and his
boyishness combined to enwrap him in the atmosphere
of romance. Few of the observers knew what
a wary vigilance lay behind that careless manner.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>Kate gathered her skirts to make room for him
beside her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you heard? He has left town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Soapy Stone. The cattlemen served notice on
him to go. So he left.&#8221;</p>
<p>A wave of relief swept over the young man.
&#8220;That&#8217;s your father&#8217;s fine work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it good?&#8221; Her eyes were shining with
gladness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m plumb satisfied,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
hankering to shoot out my little difference with
Soapy. He&#8217;s too handy with a six-gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so happy I don&#8217;t know what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose now the hold-up will be put off. Did
Sam and Blackwell go with him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. He went alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you seen Sam yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but I&#8217;ve seen Laura London. She&#8217;s all the
nice things you&#8217;ve said about her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly grew enthusiastic, &#8220;Ain&#8217;t she the dandiest
girl ever? She&#8217;s the right kind of a friend. And
pretty&mdash;with that short crinkly hair the color of
ripe nuts! You would not think one person could
own so many dimples as she does when she laughs.
It&#8217;s just like as if she had absorbed sunshine and
was warming you up with her smile.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see she has made a friend of you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You bet she has.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Cullison shot a swift slant glance at him.
&#8220;If you&#8217;ll come back this afternoon you can meet
her. I&#8217;m going to have all those dimples and all
that sunshine here in the box with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe that will draw Sam to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hoping it will. But I&#8217;m afraid not. He
avoids us. When they met he wouldn&#8217;t speak to
Father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the boy of it. Just the same he feels
pretty bad about the quarrel. I reckon there&#8217;s nothing
to do but keep an eye on him and be ready for
Soapy&#8217;s move when he makes it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so afraid something will happen to Sam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t you worry, Miss Kate. Sam is going
to come out of this all right. We&#8217;ll find a
way out for him yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Behind her smile the tears lay close. &#8220;You&#8217;re
the <i>best</i> friend. How can we ever thank you for
what you&#8217;re doing for Sam?&#8221;</p>
<p>A steer had escaped from the corral and was
galloping down the track in front of the grandstand
with its tail up. The young man&#8217;s eyes followed the
animal absently as he answered in a low voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you reckon I have forgot how a girl took
a rope from my neck one night? Do you reckon
I ever forget that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was nothing. I just spoke to the boys.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Or that I don&#8217;t remember how the man I had
shot went bail for a rustler he did not know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dick knew you. He told us about you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could he tell you any good about me? Could
he say anything except that I was a worthless
no-&#8217;count&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>She put her hand on his arm and stopped him.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t! I won&#8217;t have you say such things about
yourself. You were just a boy in trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many would have remembered that? But
you did. You fought good for my life that night.
I&#8217;ll pay my debt, part of it. The whole I never
could pay.&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice trembled in spite of the best he could
do. Their eyes did not meet, but each felt the
thrill of joy waves surging through their veins.</p>
<p>The preliminaries in the rough riding contest
took place that afternoon. Of the four who won
the right to compete in the finals, two were Curly
Flandrau and Dick Maloney. They went together
to the Cullison box to get the applause due them.</p>
<p>Kate Cullison had two guests with her. One was
Laura London, the other he had never seen. She
was a fair young woman with thick ropes of yellow
hair coiled round her head. Deep-breasted and
robust-loined, she had the rich coloring of the
Scandinavian race and much of the slow grace
peculiar to its women.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>The hostess pronounced their names. &#8220;Miss
Anderson, this is Mr. Flandrau. Mr. Flandrau&mdash;Miss
Anderson.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly glanced quickly at Kate Cullison, who
nodded. This then was the sweetheart of poor Mac.</p>
<p>Her eyes filled with tears as she took the young
man&#8217;s hand. To his surprise Curly found his throat
choking up. He could not say a word, but she
understood the unspoken sympathy. They sat together
in the back of the box.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to come and talk to you about&mdash;Mac.
Can I come this evening, say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kate gave them no more time for dwelling on
the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;You did ride so splendidly,&#8221; she told Curly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No better than Dick did,&#8221; he protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say any better than Dick. You both
did fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The judges will say you ride better. You&#8217;ve
got first place cinched,&#8221; Maloney contributed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sho! Just because I cut up fancy didoes on
a horse. Grandstand stunts are not riding. For
straight stick-to-your-saddle work I know my boss,
and his name is Dick Maloney.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll know to-morrow,&#8221; Laura London summed
up.</p>
<p>As it turned out, Maloney was the better prophet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
Curly won the first prize of five hundred dollars
and the championship belt. Dick took second place.</p>
<p>Saguache, already inclined to make a hero of the
young rustler, went wild over his victory. He
could have been chosen mayor that day if there
had been an election. To do him justice, Curly
kept his head remarkably well.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be a human clothes pin ain&#8217;t so much,&#8221; he
explained to Kate. &#8220;Just because a fellow can stick
to the hurricane deck of a bronch without pulling
leather whilst it&#8217;s making a milk shake out of him
don&#8217;t prove that he has got any more brains or
decency than the law allows. Say, ain&#8217;t this a
peach of a mo&#8217;ning.&#8221;</p>
<p>A party of young people were taking an early
morning ride through the outskirts of the little
city. Kate pulled her pony to a walk and glanced
across at him. He had taken off his hat to catch the
breeze, and the sun was picking out the golden
lights in his curly brown hair. She found herself
admiring the sure poise of the head, the flat straight
back, the virile strength of him.</p>
<p>It did not occur to her that she herself made a
picture to delight the heart. The curves of her
erect tiger-lithe young body were modeled by nature
to perfection. Radiant with the sheer pleasure of
life, happy as God&#8217;s sunshine, she was a creature
vividly in tune with the glad morning.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow, I&#8217;m glad you won.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their eyes met. A spark from his flashed deep
into hers as a star falls through the heavens on
a summer night. Each looked away. After one
breathless full-pulsed moment she recovered herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>His gaze followed hers to two riders in front of
them. One was Maloney, the other Myra Anderson.
The sound of the girl&#8217;s laughter rippled back
to them on the light breeze.</p>
<p>Curly smiled. &#8220;Yes, that would be nice. The
best I can say for her&mdash;and it&#8217;s a whole lot&mdash;is
that I believe she&#8217;s good enough for Dick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the best I can say for him is that he&#8217;s good
enough for her,&#8221; the girl retorted promptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s hope&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t think of anything that would please me
more.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked away into the burning sun on the
edge of the horizon. &#8220;I can think of one thing
that would please me more,&#8221; he murmured.</p>
<p>She did not ask him what it was, nor did he
volunteer an explanation. Perhaps it was from the
rising sun her face had taken its swift glow of warm
color.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>AT THE ROUND UP CLUB</h3>
</div>

<p>A big game had been in progress all night at the
Round Up Club. Now the garish light of day
streamed through the windows, but the electric
cluster still flung down its yellow glare upon the
table. Behind the players were other smaller tables
littered with cigars, discarded packs, and glasses
full or empty. The men were in their shirt sleeves.
Big broad-shouldered fellows they were, with the
marks of the outdoors hard-riding West upon them.
No longer young, they were still full of the vigor
and energy of unflagging strength. From bronzed
faces looked steady unwinking eyes with humorous
creases around the corners, hard eyes that judged
a man and his claims shrewdly and with good temper.
Most of them had made good in the land,
and their cattle fed upon a thousand hills.</p>
<p>The least among them physically was Luck Cullison,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
yet he was their recognized leader. There
was some innate quality in this man with the gray,
steel-chilled eyes that marked him as first in whatever
company he chose to frequent. A good friend
and a good foe, men thought seriously before they
opposed him. He had made himself a power in the
Southwest because he was the type that goes the
limit when aroused. Yet about him, too, there was
the manner of a large amiability, of the easy tolerance
characteristic of the West.</p>
<p>While Alec Flandrau shuffled and dealt, the players
relaxed. Cigars were relit, drinks ordered.
Conversation reverted to the ordinary topics that
interested Cattleland. The price of cows, the good
rains, the time of the fall roundup, were touched
upon.</p>
<p>The door opened to let in a newcomer, a slim,
graceful man much younger than the others present,
and one whose costume and manner brought
additional color into the picture. Flandrau, Senior,
continued to shuffle without turning his head. Cullison
also had his back to the door, but the man
hung his broad-rimmed gray hat on the rack&mdash;beside
an exactly similar one that belonged to the
owner of the Circle C&mdash;and moved leisurely forward
till he was within range of his vision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to prove up soon on that Del Oro claim
of yours, Luck?&#8221; asked Flandrau.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>He was now dealing, his eyes on the cards, so
that he missed the embarrassment in the faces of
those about him.</p>
<p>&#8220;On Thursday, the first day the law allows,&#8221; Cullison
answered quietly.</p>
<p>Flandrau chuckled. &#8220;I reckon Cass Fendrick
will be some sore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect.&#8221; Cullison&#8217;s gaze met coolly the black,
wrathful eyes of the man who had just come in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sort of put a crimp in his notions when you
took up the cañon draw,&#8221; Flandrau surmised.</p>
<p>Something in the strained silence struck the
dealer as unusual. He looked up, and showed a
momentary confusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t know you were there, Cass. Looks like
I put my foot in it sure that time. I ce&#8217;tainly
thought you were an absentee,&#8221; he apologized.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or you wouldn&#8217;t have been talking about me,&#8221;
retorted Fendrick acidly. The words were flung
at Flandrau, but plainly they were meant as a challenge
for Cullison.</p>
<p>A bearded man, the oldest in the party, cut in
with good-natured reproof. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t wonder,
Cass, but your name is liable to be mentioned just
like that of any other man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t know you were in this, Yesler,&#8221; Fendrick
drawled insolently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, I butted in,&#8221; the other laughed easily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
He pushed a stack of chips toward the center of
the table. &#8220;The pot&#8217;s open.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fendrick, refused a quarrel, glared at the impassive
face of Cullison, and passed to the rear
room for a drink. His impudence needed fortifying,
for he knew that since he had embarked in
the sheep business he was not welcome at this club,
that in fact certain members had suggested his
name be dropped from the books. Before he returned
to the poker table the drink he had ordered
became three.</p>
<p>The game was over and accounts were being
straightened. Cullison was the heavy loser. All
night he had been bucking hard luck. His bluffs
had been called. The others had not come in
against his strong hands. On a straight flush he
had drawn down the ante and nothing more. To
say the least, it was exasperating. But his face had
showed no anger. He had played poker too many
years, was too much a sport in the thorough-going
frontier fashion, to wince when the luck broke
badly for him.</p>
<p>The settlement showed that the owner of the Circle
C was twenty-five hundred dollars behind the
game. He owed Mackenzie twelve hundred, Flandrau
four hundred, and three hundred to Yesler.</p>
<p>With Fendrick sitting in an easy chair just across
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
the room, he found it a little difficult to say what
otherwise would have been a matter of course.</p>
<p>&#8220;My bank&#8217;s busted just now, boys. Have to ask
you to let it stand for a few days. Say, till the
end of the week.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fendrick laughed behind the paper he was pretending
to read. He knew quite well that Luck&#8217;s
word was as good as his bond, but he chose to suggest
a doubt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ll explain the joke to us, Cass,&#8221; the
owner of the Circle C said very quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I was just laughing at the things I see,
Luck,&#8221; returned the younger man with airy offense,
his eyes on the printed sheet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning for instance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just human nature. Any law against laughing?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cullison turned his back on him. &#8220;See you on
Thursday if that&#8217;s soon enough, boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the time you want, Luck. Let mine go till
after the roundup if you&#8217;d rather,&#8221; Mackenzie suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thursday suits me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cullison rose and stretched. He had impressed
his strong, dominant personality upon his clothes,
from the high-heeled boots to the very wrinkles in
the corduroy coat he was now putting on. He bad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
enemies, a good many of them, but his friends were
legion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t hurry yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll rustle the money, all right. Coming
down to the hotel?&#8221; Luck was reaching for his
hat, but turned toward his friends as he spoke.</p>
<p>Without looking again at Fendrick, he led the
way to the street.</p>
<p>The young man left alone cursed softly to himself,
and ordered another drink. He knew he was
overdoing it, but the meeting with Cullison had annoyed
him exceedingly. The men had never been
friends, and of late years they had been leaders of
hostile camps. Both of them could be overbearing,
and there was scarcely a week but their interests
overlapped. Luck was capable of great generosity,
but he could be obstinate as the rock of
Gibraltar when he chose. There had been differences
about the ownership of calves, about straying
cattle, about political matters. Finally had come
open hostility. Cass leased from the forestry department
the land upon which Cullison&#8217;s cattle had
always run free of expense. Upon this he had put
sheep, a thing in itself of great injury to the cattle
interests. The stockmen had all been banded together
in opposition to the forestry administration
of the new régime, and Luck regarded Fendrick&#8217;s
action as treachery to the common cause.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>He struck back hard. In Arizona the open range
is valuable only so long as the water holes also are
common property or a private supply available. The
Circle C cattle and those of Fendrick came down
from the range to the Del Oro to water at a point
where the cañon walls opened to a spreading valley.
This bit of meadow Luck homesteaded and fenced
on the north side, thus cutting the cattle of his enemy
from the river.</p>
<p>Cass was furious. He promptly tore down the
fence to let his cattle and sheep through. Cullison
rebuilt it, put up a shack at a point which commanded
the approach, and set a guard upon it day
and night. Open warfare had ensued, and one of
the sheepherders had been beaten because he persisted
in crossing the dead line.</p>
<p>Now Cullison was going to put the legal seal on
the matter by making final proof on his homestead.
Cass knew that if he did so it would practically put
him out of business. He would be at the mercy
of his foe, who could ruin him if he pleased.
Luck would be in a position to dictate terms absolutely.</p>
<p>Nor did it make his defeat any more palatable to
Cass that he had brought it on himself by his bad-tempered
unneighborliness and by his overreaching
disposition. A hundred times he had blacknamed
himself for an arrant fool because he had not anticipated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
the move of his enemy and homesteaded on
his own account.</p>
<p>He felt that there must be some way out of the
trap if he could only find it. Whenever the thought
of eating humble pie to Luck came into his mind,
the rage boiled in him. He swore he would not
do it. Better a hundred times to see the thing out
to a fighting finish.</p>
<p>Taking the broad-rimmed gray hat he found on
the rack, Cass passed out of the clubhouse and into
the sun-bathed street.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>LUCK MEETS AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE</h3>
</div>

<p>Cullison and his friends proceeded down Papago
street to the old plaza where their hotel was located.
Their transit was an interrupted one, for
these four cattlemen were among the best known
in the Southwest. All along the route they scattered
nods of recognition, friendly greetings, and
genial banter. One of them&mdash;the man who had
formerly been the hard-riding, quick-shooting
sheriff of the county&mdash;met also scowls once or
twice, to which he was entirely indifferent. Luck
had no slavish respect for law, had indeed, if rumor
were true, run a wild and stormy course in his
youth. But his reign as sheriff had been a terror
to lawbreakers. He had made enemies, desperate
and unscrupulous ones, who had sworn to wipe him
from among the living, and one of these he was
now to meet for the first time since the man had
stood handcuffed before him, livid with fury, and
had sworn to cut his heart out at the earliest chance.</p>
<p>It was in the lobby of the hotel that Cullison
came plump against Lute Blackwell. For just a
moment they stared at each other before the former
sheriff spoke.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Out again, eh, Blackwell?&#8221; he said easily.</p>
<p>From the bloodshot eyes one could have told at
a glance the man had been drinking heavily. From
whiskey he had imbibed a Dutch courage just bold
enough to be dangerous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m out&mdash;and back again, just as I promised,
Mr. Sheriff,&#8221; he threatened.</p>
<p>The cattleman ignored his manner. &#8220;Then I&#8217;ll
give you a piece of advice gratis. Papago County
has grown away from the old days. It has got past
the two-gun man. He&#8217;s gone to join the antelope
and the painted Indian. You&#8217;ll do well to remember
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fellow leaned forward, sneering so that his
ugly mouth looked like a crooked gash. &#8220;How
about the one-gun man, Mr. Sheriff?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t last long now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s rage boiled over. But Luck was far
and away the quicker of the two. His left hand
shot forward and gripped the rising wrist, his right
caught the hairy throat and tightened on it. He
shook the convict as if he had been a child, and
flung him, black in the face, against the wall, where
he hung, strangling and sputtering.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;ll get you yet,&#8221; the ruffian panted. But he
did not again attempt to reach for the weapon in
his hip pocket.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You talk too much with your mouth.&#8221;</p>
<p>With superb contempt, Luck slapped him, turned
on his heel, and moved away, regardless of the raw,
stark lust to kill that was searing this man&#8217;s elemental
brain.</p>
<p>Across the convict&#8217;s rage came a vision. He saw
a camp far up in the Rincons, and seated around a
fire five men at breakfast, all of them armed. Upon
them had come one man suddenly. He had dominated
the situation quietly, had made one disarm
the others, had handcuffed the one he wanted and
taken him from his friends through a hostile country
where any hour he might be shot from ambush.
Moreover, he had traveled with his prisoner
two days, always cheerful and matter of fact, not
at all uneasy as to what might lie behind the washes
or the rocks they passed. Finally he had brought
his man safely to Casa Grande, from whence he had
gone over the road to the penitentiary. Blackwell
had been the captured man, and he held a deep respect
for the prowess of the officer who had taken
him. The sheer pluck of the adventure had alone
made it possible. For such an unflawed nerve
Blackwell knew his jerky rage was no match.</p>
<p>The paroled convict recovered his breath and
slunk out of the hotel.</p>
<p>Billie Mackenzie, owner of the Fiddleback ranch,
laughed even while he disapproved. &#8220;Some day,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
Luck, you&#8217;ll get yours when you are throwing
chances at a coyote like this. You&#8217;ll guess your
man wrong, or he&#8217;ll be one glass drunker than you
figure on, and then he&#8217;ll plug you through and
through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The man that takes chances lives longest, Mac,&#8221;
his friend replied, dismissing the subject carelessly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to tuck away about three hours of sleep.
So long.&#8221; And with a nod he was gone to his
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the same Luck&#8217;s too derned rash,&#8221; Flandrau
commented. &#8220;He&#8217;ll run into trouble good and hard
one of these days. When I&#8217;m in Rattlesnake Gulch
I don&#8217;t aim to pick posies too unobservant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie looked worried. No man lived whom
he admired so much as Luck Cullison. &#8220;And he
hadn&#8217;t ought to be sitting in these big games. He&#8217;s
hard up. Owes a good bit here and there. Always
was a spender. First thing he&#8217;ll have to sell the
Circle C to square things. He&#8217;ll pay us this week
like he said he would. That&#8217;s dead sure. He&#8217;d die
before he&#8217;d fall down on it, now Fendrick has got
his back up. But I swear I don&#8217;t know where he&#8217;ll
raise the price. Money is so tight right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>That afternoon Luck called at every bank in
Saguache. All of the bankers knew him and were
friendly to him, but in spite of their personal regard
they could do nothing for him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s this stringency, Luck,&#8221; Jordan of the Cattlemen&#8217;s
National explained to him. &#8220;We can&#8217;t let
a dollar go even on the best security. You know
I&#8217;d like to let you have it, but it wouldn&#8217;t be right
to the bank. We&#8217;ve got to keep our reserve up.
Why, I&#8217;m lying awake nights trying to figure out a
way to call in more of our money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not asking much, Jack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Luck, I&#8217;d let you have it if I dared. Why,
we&#8217;re running close to the wind. Public confidence
is a mighty ticklish thing. If I didn&#8217;t have twenty
thousand coming from El Paso on the Flyer to-night
I&#8217;d be uneasy for the bank.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty thousand on the Flyer. I reckon you
ship by express, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Don&#8217;t mention it to anyone. That twenty
thousand would come handy to a good many people
in this country these times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would come right handy to me,&#8221; Luck
laughed ruefully. &#8220;I need every cent of it. After
the beef roundup, I&#8217;ll be on Easy Street, but it&#8217;s
going to be hard sledding to keep going till then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll make a turn somehow. It will work out.
Maybe when money isn&#8217;t so tight I&#8217;ll be able to do
something for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luck returned to the hotel morosely, and tried
to figure a way out of his difficulties. He was not
going to be beaten. He never had accepted defeat,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
even in the early days when he had sometimes taken
a lawless short cut to what he wanted. By God,
he would not lose out after all these years of fighting.
It had been his desperate need of money that
had made him sit in last night&#8217;s poker game. But
he had succeeded only in making a bad situation
worse. He knew his debts by heart, but he jotted
them down on the back of an envelope and added
them again.</p>
<table summary=''>
<tr><td>Mortgage on ranch (due Oct. 1),</td><td align='right'>$13,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>Note to First National,</td><td align='right'>3,500</td></tr>
<tr><td>Note to Reynolds,</td><td align='right'>1,750</td></tr>
<tr><td>I O U to Mackenzie,</td><td align='right'>1,200</td></tr>
<tr><td>Same to Flandrau,</td><td align='right'>400</td></tr>
<tr><td>Same to Yesler,</td><td align='right'>300</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td align='right'>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right' colspan='2'>Total, $20,150</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Twenty thousand was the sum he needed, and
mighty badly, too. Absentmindedly he turned the
envelope over and jotted down one or two other
things. Twenty thousand dollars! Just the sum
Jordan had coming to the bank on the Flyer. Subconsciously,
Luck&#8217;s fingers gave expression to his
thoughts. $20,000. Half a dozen times they penciled
it, and just below the figures, &#8220;W.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;S. Ex.
Co.&#8221; Finally they wrote automatically the one
word, &#8220;To-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luck looked at what he had written, laughed
grimly, and tore the envelope in two. He threw
the pieces in the waste paper basket.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>AN INITIALED HAT</h3>
</div>

<p>Mackenzie was reading the <i>Sentinel</i> while he ate
a late breakfast. He had it propped against the
water bottle, so that it need not interfere with the
transportation of sausages, fried potatoes, hot cakes,
and coffee to their common destination.</p>
<p>Trying to do two things at once has its disadvantages.
A startling headline caught his eyes just
as the cup was at his lips. Hot coffee, precipitately
swallowed, scalded his tongue and throat. He set
down the cup, swore mildly, and gave his attention
to the news that had excited him. The reporter
had run the story to a column, but the leading
paragraph gave the gist of it:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>While the citizens of Saguache were
peacefully sleeping last night, a lone
bandit held up the messengers of the
Western and Southern Express Company,
and relieved them of $20,000 just received
from El Paso on the Flyer.</p>
<p>Perry Hawley, the local manager of the
company, together with Len Rogers, the
armed guard, had just returned from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
depot, where the money had been turned
over to them and receipted for. Hawley
had unlocked the door of the office and
had stepped in, followed by Rogers, when
a masked desperado appeared suddenly
out of the darkness, disarmed the guard
and manager, took the money, passed
through the door and locked it after him,
and vanished as silently as he had come.
Before leaving, he warned his victims that
the place would be covered for ten minutes
and at any attempt to call for help
they would be shot. Notwithstanding
this, the imprisoned men risked their lives
by raising the alarm.</p>
</div>
<p>Further down the page Mackenzie discovered
that the desperado was still at large, but that Sheriff
Bolt expected shortly to lay hands on him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet a dollar Nick Bolt didn&#8217;t make any such
claim to the reporter. He ain&#8217;t the kind that
brags,&#8221; Mackenzie told himself.</p>
<p>He folded the paper and returned to his room
to make preparation to return to his ranch. The
buzz of the telephone called him to the receiver.
The voice of Cullison reached him.</p>
<p>&#8220;That you, Mac. I&#8217;ll be right up. No, don&#8217;t
come down. I&#8217;d rather see you alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>The owner of the Circle C came right to business.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve made a raise, Mac, and while I&#8217;ve got
it I&#8217;m going to skin off what&#8217;s coming to you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>He had taken a big roll of bills from his pocket,
and was counting off what he had lost to his friend.
The latter noticed that it all seemed to be in twenties.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twelve hundred. That squares us, Mac.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Scotchman was vaguely uneasy without a
definite reason for his anxiety. Only last night
Cullison had told him not a single bank in town
would advance him a dollar. Now he had money
in plenty. Where had he got it?</p>
<p>&#8220;No hurry at all, Luck. Pay when you&#8217;re good
and ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;ll only put it in the Cattlemen&#8217;s National.
It&#8217;s yours if you need it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll let you know if I do,&#8221; his friend nodded.</p>
<p>Mackenzie&#8217;s eye fell on a copy of the <i>Sentinel</i>
protruding from the other&#8217;s pocket. &#8220;Read about
the hold-up of the W.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;S. Express? That fellow
had his nerve with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sho! This hold-up game&#8217;s the easiest yet. He
got the drop on them, and there was nothing to it.
The key was still in the lock of the door. Well,
when he gets through he steps out, turns the key,
and rides away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did he know there was money coming in
last night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s always a leak about things of that sort.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
Somebody talks. I knew it myself for that matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You knew! Who told you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a secret, Mac. Come to think of it, I
wish you wouldn&#8217;t tell anybody that I knew. I
don&#8217;t want to get the man who told me in trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure I won&#8217;t.&#8221; He passed to another phase of
the subject. &#8220;The <i>Sentinel</i> says Bolt expects to
catch the robber. Think he will?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if the fellow knows his business. Bolt has
nothing to go on. He has the whole Southwest to
pick from. For all he knows, it was you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or more likely me.&#8221; The gray eyes of the
former sheriff held a frosty smile.</p>
<p>In spite of that smile, or perhaps because of it,
Mackenzie felt again that flash of doubt. &#8220;What&#8217;s
the use of talking foolishness, Luck? Course you
didn&#8217;t do it. Anybody would know that. Man, I
whiles wonder at you,&#8221; he protested, relapsing into
his native tongue as he sometimes did when excited.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say I did it. I said I might have done
it&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well! You didn&#8217;t. I know you too well.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the trouble was Mackenzie did not know him
well enough. Cullison was hard up, close to the
wall. How far would he go to save himself?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
Thirty years before when they had been wild young
lads these two had hunted their fun together. Luck
had always been the leader, had always been ready
for any daredeviltry that came to his mind. He
had been the kind to go the limit in whatever he
undertook, to play it to a finish in spite of opposition.
And what a man is he must be to the end.
In his slow, troubled fashion, Mac wondered if his
old side partner&#8217;s streak of lawlessness would take
him as far as a hold-up. Of course it would not,
he assured himself; but he could not get the ridiculous
notion out of his head. It drew his thoughts,
and at last his steps toward the express office where
the hold-up had taken place.</p>
<p>He opened a futile conversation with Hawley,
while Len Rogers, the guard who had not
made good, looked at him with a persistent, hostile
eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hard luck,&#8221; the cattleman condoled.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what you think, is it? You and your
friends, too, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie looked at the guard, who was plainly
sore in every humiliated crevice of his brain. &#8220;I
ain&#8217;t speaking for my friends, Len, but for myself,&#8221;
he said amiably.</p>
<p>Rogers laughed harshly. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t know but
what you might be speaking for one of your
friends.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They can all speak for themselves when they
have got anything to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hawley sent a swift, warning look toward his
subordinate. The latter came to time sulkily. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t say they couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie drifted from this unfriendly atmosphere
to the courthouse. He found Sheriff Bolt in
his office. It was that official&#8217;s busy day, but he
found time not only to see the owner of the Fiddleback,
but to press upon him cordially an invitation
to sit down and smoke. The Scotchman wanted
to discuss the robbery, but was shy about attacking
the subject. While he boggled at it, Bolt was
off on another tack.</p>
<p>Inside of a quarter of an hour the sheriff had
found out all he wanted to know about the poker
game, Cullison&#8217;s financial difficulties, and the news
that Luck had liquidated his poker debt since breakfast
time. He had turned the simple cattleman&#8217;s
thoughts inside out, was aware of the doubt Billie
had scarcely admitted to himself, and knew all he
did except the one point Luck had asked him not
to mention. Moreover, he had talked so casually
that his visitor had no suspicion of what he was
driving at.</p>
<p>Mackenzie attempted a little sleuthing of his
own. &#8220;This hold-up fellow kind of slipped one
over on you last night, Bolt.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe so, and maybe not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got a clew, have you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes&mdash;yes.&#8221; The sheriff looked straight at
him. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a notion his initials are L.&nbsp;C.&#8221;</p>
<p>Billie felt himself flushing. &#8220;What makes you
think that, Nick?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bolt walked to a cupboard and unlocked it. His
back was toward the cattleman, but the latter could
see him take something from a shelf. Turning
quickly, the sheriff tossed a hat upon the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever see this before?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mac picked it up. His fingers were not quite
steady, for a great dread drenched his heart like a
rush of icy water. Upon that gray felt hat with
the pinched crown was stamped the individuality&mdash;and
the initials&mdash;of Luck Cullison.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know as I recognize it,&#8221; he lied, not very
readily. &#8220;Not to know it. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought perhaps you might know it. The
hold-up dropped it while getting away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie&#8217;s eyes flinched. &#8220;Dropped it. How
was that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A man happened to come along San Miguel
street just as the robber swung to his horse. He
heard the cries of the men inside, guessed what
was doing, and exchanged shots with the miscreant.
He shot this hat off the fellow&#8217;s head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The <i>Sentinel</i> didn&#8217;t tell any such a story.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t give that detail to the editor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was the man that shot the robber?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cass Fendrick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he didn&#8217;t claim to recognize the hold-up?&#8221;
Mackenzie forced himself to ask this in spite of his
fears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for certain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he&mdash;he had a guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mac. He guessed a man whose initials
are the same as those in that hat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who do you mean, Nick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need to tell you that. You know who.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you mean Luck Cullison, it&#8217;s a damned lie,&#8221;
exploded the cattleman. He was furious with himself,
for he felt now that he had been unsuspectingly
helping to certify the suspicions of the sheriff.
Like an idiot, he had let out much that told
heavily against his friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cass Fendrick is not on good terms with him.
We all know that. Luck has got him in a hole. I
wouldn&#8217;t put it a bit above Cass to lie if he thought
it would hurt Luck. Tell you it&#8217;s a damned conspiracy.
Man, can&#8217;t you see that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about this hat, with the two holes shot
through the rim?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sho! We all wear hats just like that. Look at
mine.&#8221; Billie held it out eagerly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Has yours an L.&nbsp;C. stamped in the sweat
band?&#8221; Bolt asked with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you ain&#8217;t his friend, Nick. But you
want to be fair to him even if he did oppose your
election.&#8221; Mackenzie laid an appealing hand on
the knee of the man seated opposite him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sheriff of Papago County. It doesn&#8217;t make
any difference who worked for or against me, Billie.
I was elected, and I&#8217;m going to enforce the
law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you think Luck would do a fool thing like
this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say I thought so, but it&#8217;s my business
not to overlook any bets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you do believe it. Now, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since you&#8217;ve got to have an answer&mdash;yes, I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By heaven, I&#8217;d as lief think I did it myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a good friend,&#8221; Bolt conceded. &#8220;By
the way, I&#8217;ve got to pay for some supplies this
morning. Can you cash a check for a hundred?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon so.&#8221; Mackenzie drew from his pocket
the roll Cullison had given him two hours before.
He peeled five twenties from it. The sheriff observed
that the prevailing denomination was the
same.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get these from Luck?&#8221; he asked carelessly.</p>
<p>The cattleman stared at him, and the suspicion
grew on him that he had been trapped again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you ask?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it happens the bills stolen from the
W.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;S. were all twenties.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t get them from Cullison. This is
money I had,&#8221; he answered sullenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I dare say you can let me see the money
you got from him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He paid me by check.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Banked it yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my business, Nick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And mine, Billie. I can find out from the bank
if you have. Besides, I happen to know that Luck&#8217;s
bank account is overdrawn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one has been at you to prejudice you,
Bolt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody but Luck Cullison himself&mdash;and his
actions.&#8221;</p>
<p>From the office of the sheriff, Mackenzie wandered
to the club in search of Luck. He was thoroughly
dispirited, both dreaded to meet Luck, and
yet was anxious to do so. For he wanted to warn
him, wanted to see him fall into one of his chill
rages when he told him there were suspicions
against him.</p>
<p>Cullison had left the club, but Alec Flandrau
was still there. Billie drew him into a corner, and
learned that Luck had just settled with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone see him give it to you, Alec?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No. He took me upstairs to the library and
paid me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In bills?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;in twenties.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t tell anybody that.&#8221; In a
dozen jerky sentences the owner of the Fiddleback
told Flandrau of the suspicions of the sheriff.</p>
<p>Together they went in search of Luck. But
though they looked for him all day, he was not to
be found. They might have concluded he had ridden
out to the ranch, but his horse was still at the
stable where he had left it.</p>
<p>The last that had been seen of him Luck was
walking along the plaza toward the hotel, not a
hundred and fifty yards from the latter. A dozen
men had spoken to him in the distance of a block.
But he had not been seen to reach his hotel. He
had not called for his room key. Somehow he had
vanished, and none could tell how or where.</p>
<p>To Bolt his disappearance was as good as a confession
of guilt. He searched Luck&#8217;s room at the
hotel. Among other things, he found an old envelope
with interesting data penciled on it.</p>
<p>Before nightfall the word was whispered all over
Saguache that Luck Cullison, pioneer cattleman and
former sheriff, was suspected of the W.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;S. Express
robbery and had fled to save himself from
arrest. At first men marveled that one so well
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
known and so popular, one who had been so prominent
in affairs, could be suspected of such a crime,
but as they listened to the evidence and saw it fall
like blocks of a building into place, the conviction
grew that he was the masked bandit wanted by the
sheriff.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>KATE USES HER QUIRT</h3>
</div>

<p>Red-headed Bob Cullison finished making the
diamond hitch and proudly called his cousin Kate
to inspect the packhorse.</p>
<p>&#8220;You never saw the hitch thrown better, sis,&#8221; he
bragged, boy-like. &#8220;Uncle Luck says I do it well
as he can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine, Bob,&#8221; his cousin agreed, with the
proper enthusiasm in her dark eyes. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have
to teach me how to do it one of these days.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was in a khaki riding skirt, and she pulled
herself to the saddle of her own horse. From this
position she gave him final instructions before leaving.
&#8220;Stay around the house, Bob. Dad will call
the ranch up this morning probably, and I want
you to be where you can hear the &#8217;phone ring.
Tell him about that white-faced heifer, and to be
sure to match the goods I gave him. You&#8217;ll find
dinner set out for you on the dining-room table.&#8221;</p>
<p>It had been on Wednesday morning that Luck
Cullison disappeared from the face of the earth.
Before twenty-four hours the gossip was being
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
whispered in the most distant cañons of Papago
County. The riders of the Circle C knew it, but
none of them had yet told either Bob or Kate.</p>
<p>Now it was Friday morning and Kate was beginning
to wonder why her father did not call her
up. Could it be that Soapy Stone was pulling off
his train robbery at Tin Cup and her father so busy
that he could not take time to ride to a telephone
station? She did not like to leave the ranch just
now, even for a few hours, but other business called
her away. Sweeney was holding down the fort at
the Del Oro against Fendrick&#8217;s sheepherders, and
his weekly supply of provisions had to be taken to
him. Since she wanted to see with her own eyes
how things were getting along at the cañon, she
was taking the supplies in person.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful morning, even for Arizona.
The soft air was at its winiest best. The spring
rains had carpeted the hills with an unusually fine
grass, and the summer suns had not yet burnt this
to the crisp brown of August. Her young heart
expanded with the very joy of life. Oh, how good
it was to be alive in a world of warm sunshine, of
blue, unflecked sky, and of cool, light breezes.
Swifts basked on the rocks or darted like arrows
for safety, and lay palpitating with suspense. The
clear call of the quails sounded to right and left of
her. To her eager consciousness it was as if some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
bath of splendor had poured down overnight upon
the old earth.</p>
<p>She rode from sunlight into shadow and from
shadow to sunlight again, winding along the hill
trail that took her toward the Del Oro. After
hours of travel she came to the saddle from which
one looked down to the gap in the cañon walls that
had been the common watering place of all men&#8217;s
cattle, but now was homesteaded by her father. Far
below her it lay, a dwarfed picture with detail
blurred to a vague impressionistic map. She could
see the hut, the fence line running parallel to the
stream on the other side, some grazing cattle,
Sweeney&#8217;s horse in the corral.</p>
<p>The piteous bleating of a lamb floated to her.
Kate dismounted and made her way toward the
sound. A pathetic little huddle of frightened life
tried to struggle free at her approach. The slim
leg of the lamb had become wedged at the intersection
of several rocks in such a way that it could
not be withdrawn.</p>
<p>Kate pulled the boulder away, and released the
prisoner. It looked at her and bleated without attempting
to move. She took the soft, woolly creature
in her arms, and examined the wounded limb,
all torn and raw from its efforts to escape. A
wound, she recalled, ought to be washed with cold
water and bound. Returning to her horse, she put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
the little animal in front of the saddle and continued
on the trail that led down to the river.</p>
<p>Sweeney came out from the cabin and hailed her.
He was a squat, weather-beaten man, who had ridden
for her father ever since she could remember.</p>
<p>&#8220;What in Mexico you got there?&#8221; he asked in
surprise.</p>
<p>She explained the circumstances under which she
had found the lamb.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what you aiming to do with it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to tie up its leg and take it across
the river. Some of the C.&nbsp;F. herders are sure to
find it before night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sho! What are you fooling with Cass Fendrick&#8217;s
sheep for?&#8221; he grumbled.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t a sheep, but a lamb. And I&#8217;m not going
to see it suffer, no matter who owns it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was already walking toward the river. Protestingly
he followed, and lent a hand at tying up
the leg with the girl&#8217;s handkerchief.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll just ride across and leave it outside the
fence,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lemme go. I know the river better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sweeney did not wait for her assent, but swung
to the saddle. She handed him the lamb, and he
forded the stream. At no place did the water come
above the fetlocks of the horse.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you know the dangerous places. Be
careful you don&#8217;t drown,&#8221; she mocked.</p>
<p>The rider&#8217;s laughter rang back to her. One of
her jokes went a long way with Sweeney. The
danger of the river had been the flimsiest of excuses.
What he had been afraid of was that one
of Fendrick&#8217;s herders might be lurking in some
arroyo beyond the fence. There was little chance
that he would dare hurt her, but he might shout
something unpleasant.</p>
<p>In point of fact, Sweeney saw some one disappear
into a wash as he reached the fence. The rider
held up the lamb, jabbered a sentence of broncho
Spanish at the spot where the man had been, put
down his bleating burden, and cantered back to his
own side of the river without unnecessary delay.
No bullets had yet been fired in the Cullison-Fendrick
feud, but a &#8220;greaser&#8221; was liable to do anything,
according to the old puncher&#8217;s notion. Anyhow,
he did not want to be a temptation to anyone
with a gun in his hand.</p>
<p>An hour later, Kate, on the return trip, topped
the rise where she had found the lamb. Pulling up
her pony, to rest the horse from its climb, she
gazed back across the river to the rolling ridges
among which lay the C.&nbsp;F. ranch. Oddly enough,
she had never seen Cass Fendrick. He had come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
to Papago County a few years before, and had
bought the place from an earlier settler. In the
disagreement that had fallen between the two men,
she was wholly on the side of her father. Sometimes
she had wondered what manner of man this
Cass Fendrick might be; disagreeable, of course, but
after precisely what fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your property, I believe, Miss Cullison.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned at sound of the suave, amused drawl,
and looked upon a dark, slim young man of picturesque
appearance. He was bowing to her with
an obvious intention of overdoing it. Voice and
manner had the habit of the South rather than of
the West. A kind of indolent irony sat easily upon
the swarthy face crowned with a black sleek head
of hair.</p>
<p>Her instinct told the girl who he was. She did
not need to ask herself any longer what Cass Fendrick
looked like.</p>
<p>He was holding out to her the bloodstained kerchief
that had been tied to the lamb&#8217;s leg.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t care to have it returned,&#8221; she told him
with cold civility.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, if you&#8217;d only left a note to say so, it
would have saved me a quite considerable climb,&#8221;
he suggested.</p>
<p>In spite of herself a flicker of amusement lit her
eyes. She had a sense of humor, &#8220;I did not think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
of that, and since you have troubled to return it to
me, I can only say thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She held out her hand for the kerchief, but
he did not move. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know but what I&#8217;ll
keep it, after all, for a souvenir. Just to
remind me that Luck Cullison&#8217;s daughter went
out of her way to help one of Cass Fendrick&#8217;s
sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>She ignored his sardonic mockery. &#8220;I don&#8217;t let
live creatures suffer when I can help it. Are you
going to give me my handkerchief?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t made up my mind yet. Perhaps I&#8217;ll
have it washed and bring it home to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She decided that he was trying to flirt with her,
and turned the head of her horse to start.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now your father has pulled his freight, I expect
it will be safe to call,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The bridle rein tightened. &#8220;What nonsense are
you saying about my father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No news, Miss Cullison; just what everybody is
saying, that he has gone to cover on account of the
hold-up.&#8221;</p>
<p>A chill fear drenched her heart. &#8220;Do you mean
the hold-up of the Limited at Tin Cup?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t.&#8221; He looked at her sharply. &#8220;Mean
to say you haven&#8217;t heard of the hold-up of the W.&amp; S.
Express Company at Saguache?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. When was it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Tuesday night. The man got away with
twenty thousand dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what has my father to do with that?&#8221; she
demanded haughtily.</p>
<p>A satisfied spleen purred in his voice. &#8220;My dear
young lady, that is what everyone is asking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean? Say it.&#8221; There was fear
as well as anger in her voice. Had her father
somehow got into trouble trying to save Sam?</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m saying nothing. But what Sheriff Bolt
means is that when he gets his handcuffs on Luck
Cullison, he&#8217;ll have the man that can tell him where
that twenty thousand is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>He waved his hand airily, as one who declined
responsibility in the matter, but his dark, saturnine
face sparkled with malice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe so. Seems to be some evidence, but I
reckon he can explain that away&mdash;when he comes
back. The hold-up dropped a hat with the initials
L.&nbsp;C. in the band, since identified as his. He had
lost a lot of money at poker. Next day he paid it.
He had no money in the bank, but maybe he found
it growing on a cactus bush.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You liar!&#8221; she panted, eyes blazing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take that from you, my dear, because you
look so blamed pretty when you&#8217;re mad; but I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
wouldn&#8217;t take it from him&mdash;from your father, who
is hiding out in the hills somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anger uncurbed welled from her in an inarticulate
cry. He had come close to her, and was standing
beside the stirrup, one bold hand upon the rein.
Her quirt went swiftly up and down, cut like a
thin bar of red-hot iron across his uplifted face.
He stumbled back, half blind with the pain. Before
he could realize what had happened the spur
on her little boot touched the side of the pony, and
it was off with a bound. She was galloping wildly
down the trail toward home.</p>
<p>He looked after her, fingers caressing the welt
that burned his cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll pay for that, Kate Cullison,&#8221; he said
aloud to himself.</p>
<p>Anger stung him, but deeper than his rage was a
growing admiration. How she had lashed out at
him because he had taunted her of her father. By
Jove, a girl like that would be worth taming! His
cold eyes glittered as he put the bloodstained kerchief
in his pocket. She was not through with him
yet&mdash;not by a good deal.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>&#8220;AIN&#8217;T SHE THE GAMEST LITTLE THOROUGHBRED?&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>Kate galloped into the ranch plaza around which
the buildings were set, slipped from her pony, and
ran at once to the telephone. Bob was on a side
porch mending a bridle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you heard anything from dad?&#8221; she cried
through the open door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; he answered, hammering down a rivet.</p>
<p>Kate called up the hotel where Maloney was
staying at Saguache, but could not get him. She
tried the Del Mar, where her father and his friends
always put up when in town. She asked in turn
for Mackenzie, for Yesler, for Alec Flandrau.</p>
<p>While she waited for an answer, the girl moved
nervously about the room. She could not sit down
or settle herself at anything. For some instinct
told her that Fendrick&#8217;s taunt was not a lie cut out
of whole cloth.</p>
<p>The bell rang. Instantly she was at the telephone.
Mackenzie was at the other end of the line.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Uncle Mac.&#8221; She had called him uncle
ever since she could remember. &#8220;What is it they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
are saying about dad? Tell me it isn&#8217;t true,&#8221; she
begged.</p>
<p>&#8220;A pack of lees, lassie.&#8221; His Scotch idiom and
accent had succumbed to thirty years on the plains,
but when he became excited it rose triumphant
through the acquired speech of the Southwest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then is he there&mdash;in Saguache, I mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No-o. He&#8217;s not in town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hoots! He&#8217;ll just have gone somewhere on
business.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not bluff well. Through the hearty assurance
she pierced to the note of trouble in his
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re hiding something from me, Uncle Mac.
I won&#8217;t have it. You tell me the truth&mdash;the whole
truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>In three sentences he sketched it for her, and
when he had finished he knew by the sound of her
voice that she was greatly frightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something has happened to him. I&#8217;m coming
to town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you feel you&#8217;d rather. Take the stage in to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;m coming to-night. I&#8217;ll bring Bob.
Save us two rooms at the hotel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better wait till to-morrow. Forty miles is a
long ride, lass.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t wait. Have Curly Flandrau come
to the Del Mar if he&#8217;s in town&mdash;and Dick Maloney,
too. That&#8217;s all. Good-by.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned to her cousin, who was standing big-eyed
at her elbow.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Kate? Has anything happened to
Uncle Luck?&#8221;</p>
<p>She swallowed a lump in her throat. &#8220;Dad&#8217;s
gone, Bob. Nobody knows where. They say&mdash;the
liars&mdash;that he robbed the W.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;S. Express Company.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly her face went down into her forearm
on the table and sobs began to rack her body. The
boy, staggered at this preposterous charge, could
only lay his hand on her shoulder and beg her not
to cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be all right, Kate. Wait till Uncle Luck
comes back. He&#8217;ll make &#8217;em sick for talking about
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But suppose he&mdash;suppose he&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She dared
not complete what was in her mind, that perhaps
he had been ambushed by some of his enemies and
killed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet they&#8217;ll drop into a hole and pull it in
after them when Uncle Luck shows up,&#8221; the boy
bragged with supreme confidence.</p>
<p>His cousin nodded, choking down her sobs. &#8220;Of
course. It&mdash;it&#8217;ll come out all right&mdash;as soon as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
finds out what they&#8217;re saying. Saddle two horses
right away, Bob.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. We&#8217;ll soon find where he is, I bet you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The setting sun found their journey less than
half done. The brilliant rainbow afterglow of sunset
faded to colder tints, and then disappeared. The
purple saw-toothed range softened to a violet hue.
With the coming of the moon the hard, dry desert
lost detail, took on a loveliness of tone and outline
that made it an idealized painting of itself.
Myriads of stars were out, so that the heavens
seemed sown with them as an Arizona hillside is
in spring with yellow poppies.</p>
<p>Kate was tortured with anxiety, but the surpassing
beauty that encompassed them was somehow a
comfort to her. Deep within her something denied
that her father could be gone out of a world so
good. And if he were alive, Curly Flandrau would
find him&mdash;Curly and Dick between them. Luck
Cullison had plenty of good friends who would not
stand by and see him wronged.</p>
<p>Any theory of his disappearance that accepted his
guilt did not occur to her mind for an instant. The
two had been very close to each other. Luck had
been in the habit of saying smilingly that she was
his majordomo, his right bower. Some share of
his lawless temperament she inherited, enough to
feel sure that this particular kind of wrongdoing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
was impossible for him. He was reckless, sometimes
passionate, but she did not need to reassure
herself that he was scrupulously honest.</p>
<p>This brought her back to the only other tenable
hypothesis&mdash;foul play. And from this she shrank
with a quaking heart. For surely if his enemies
wished to harm him they would destroy him, and
this was a conclusion against which she fought desperately.</p>
<p>The plaza clock boomed ten strokes as they rode
into Saguache. Mackenzie was waiting for them
on the steps of the hotel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have they&mdash;has anything been&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>The owner of the Fiddleback shook his grizzled
head. &#8220;Not yet. Didn&#8217;t you meet Curly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He rode out to come in with you, but if he
didn&#8217;t meet you by ten he was to come back. You
took the north road, I reckon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>His warm heart was wrung for the young
woman whose fine eyes stared with dumb agony
from a face that looked very white in the shining
moonlight. He put an arm around her shoulders,
and drew her into the hotel with cheerful talk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along, Bob. We&#8217;re going to tuck away
a good supper first off. While you&#8217;re eating, I&#8217;ll
tell you all there is to be told.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>Kate opened her lips to say that she was not hungry
and could not possibly eat a bite, but she
thought better of it. Bob had tasted nothing since
noon, and of course he must be fed.</p>
<p>The lad fell to with an appetite grief had not
dulled. His cousin could at first only pick at what
was set before her. It seemed heartless to be sitting
down in comfort to so good a supper while her
father was in she knew not how great distress.
Grief swelled in her throat, and forced back the
food she was trying to eat.</p>
<p>Mackenzie broke off his story to remonstrate.
&#8220;This won&#8217;t do at all, Kate. If you&#8217;re going to
help find Luck, you&#8217;ve got to keep yourself fit.
Now, you try this chicken, honey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;just can&#8217;t, Uncle Mac.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you need it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; the girl confessed, and as she said it
broke down again into soft weeping.</p>
<p>Mac let her have her cry out, petting her awkwardly.
Presently she dried her eyes, set at her
supper in a businesslike way, heard the story to an
end quietly, and volunteered one heartbroken comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;As if father <i>could</i> do such a thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cattleman agreed eagerly. There were times
when he was full of doubt on that point, but he was
not going to let her know it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>Curly came into the room, and the girl rose to
meet him. He took her little hand in his tanned,
muscular one, and somehow from his grip she
gathered strength. He would do all that could be
done to find her father, just as he had done so
much to save her brother.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;ve come,&#8221; she said simply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re glad,&#8221; he smiled cheerfully.</p>
<p>He knew she had been crying, that she was suffering
cruelly, but he offered her courage rather
than maudlin sympathy. Hope seemed to flow
through her veins at the meeting of the eyes.
Whatever a man could do for her would be done by
Curly.</p>
<p>They talked the situation over together.</p>
<p>&#8220;As it looks to me, we&#8217;ve got to find out two
things&mdash;first, what has become of your father, and,
second, who did steal that money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;re talking,&#8221; Mackenzie agreed. &#8220;I
always did say you had a good head, Curly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see it yet, but there&#8217;s some link between
the two things. I mean between the robbery and
his disappearance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you mean?&#8221; Kate asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll say the robbers were his enemies&mdash;some
of the Soapy Stone outfit maybe. They have got
him out of the way to satisfy their grudge and to
make people think he did it. Unfortunately there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
is evidence that makes it look as if he might have
done it&mdash;what they call corroborating testimony.&#8221;</p>
<p>Billie Mackenzie scratched his gray poll. &#8220;Hold
on, Curly. This notion of a link between the
hold-up and Luck&#8217;s leaving is what the other side
is tying to. Don&#8217;t we want to think different from
them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We do. They think he is guilty. We know he
isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does Sheriff Bolt think?&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly waved the sheriff aside. &#8220;It don&#8217;t matter
what he thinks, Miss Kate. He <i>says</i> he thinks
Luck was mixed up in the hold-up. Maybe that&#8217;s
what he thinks, but we don&#8217;t want to forget that
Cass Fendrick made him sheriff and your father
fought him to a fare-you-well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we can&#8217;t expect any help from him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much. He ain&#8217;t a bad fellow, Bolt ain&#8217;t.
He&#8217;ll be square, but his notions are liable to be
warped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to talk with him,&#8221; the young woman
announced.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; Mackenzie assented. &#8220;To-morrow
mo&#8217;ning&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, to-night, Uncle Mac.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cattleman looked at her in surprise. Her
voice rang with decision. Her slight figure seemed
compact of energy and resolution. Was this the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
girl who had been in helpless tears not ten minutes
before?</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see if he&#8217;s at his office. Maybe he&#8217;ll come
up,&#8221; Curly said.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;ll go down to the courthouse if he&#8217;s
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flandrau got Bolt on the telephone at his room.
After a little grumbling he consented to meet Miss
Cullison at his office.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bob, you must go to bed. You&#8217;re tired out,&#8221;
his cousin told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t, either,&#8221; he denied indignantly. &#8220;Tired
nothing. I&#8217;m going with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly caught Kate&#8217;s glance, and she left the boy
to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Bob. We&#8217;re at the beginning of a
big job. Some of us have to keep fresh all the
time. We&#8217;ll work in relays. To-night you sleep so
as to be ready to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>This way of putting it satisfied the boy. He reluctantly
consented to go to bed, and was sound
asleep almost as soon as his head struck the pillow.</p>
<p>At the office of the sheriff, Kate cut to essentials
as soon as introductions were over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think my father robbed the W.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;S.
Express Company, Mr. Bolt?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>Her plainness embarrassed the officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s took at the facts, Miss Cullison,&#8221; he began
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
amiably. &#8220;Then you tell me what you would think
in my place. Your father needed money mighty
bad. There&#8217;s no doubt at all about that. Here&#8217;s an
envelope on which he had written a list of his debts.
You&#8217;ll notice they run to just a little more than
twenty thousand. I found this in his bedroom the
day he disappeared.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took the paper, glanced at it mechanically,
and looked at the sheriff again. &#8220;Well? Everybody
wants money. Do they all steal it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Turn that envelope over, Miss Cullison. Notice
how he has written there half a dozen times in a
row, &#8216;$20,000,&#8217; and just below it twice, &#8216;W.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;S.
Ex. Co.&#8217; Finally, the one word, &#8216;To-night.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>She read it all, read it with a heart heavy as lead,
and knew that there he had left in his own strong,
bold handwriting convincing evidence against himself.
Still, she did not doubt him in the least, but
there could be no question now that he knew of
the intended shipment, that absent-mindedly he had
jotted down this data while he was thinking about
it in connection with his own debts.</p>
<p>The sheriff went on tightening the chain of evidence
in a voice that for all its kindness seemed to
her remorseless as fate. &#8220;It turns out that Mr. Jordan
of the Cattleman&#8217;s National Bank mentioned
this shipment to your father that morning. Mr.
Cullison was trying to raise money from him, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
he couldn&#8217;t let him have it. Every bank in the city
refused him a loan. Yet next morning he paid off
two thousand dollars he owed from a poker game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He must have borrowed the money from some
one,&#8221; she said weakly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That money he paid in twenty-dollar bills. The
stolen express package was in twenties. You know
yourself that this is a gold country. Bills ain&#8217;t so
plentiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s hand went to her heart. Faith in her
father was a rock not to be washed away by any
amount of evidence. What made her wince was
the amount of circumstantial testimony falling into
place so inexorably against him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221; she asked despairingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish it were, Miss Cullison. But it&#8217;s not. A
man came round the corner and shot at the robber
as he was escaping. His hat fell off. Here it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Kate took the hat something seemed to
tighten around her heart. It belonged to her father.
His personality was stamped all over it. She
even recognized a coffee stain on the under side of
the brim. There was no need of the initials L.&nbsp;C.
to tell her whose it had been. A wave of despair
swept over her. Again she was on the verge of
breaking down, but controlled herself as with a
tight curb.</p>
<p>Bolt&#8217;s voice went on. &#8220;Next day your father disappeared,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
Miss Cullison. He was here in town all
morning. His friends knew that suspicion was
fastening on him. The inference is that he daren&#8217;t
wait to have the truth come out. Mind, I don&#8217;t
say he&#8217;s guilty. But it looks that way. Now, that&#8217;s
my case. If you were sheriff in my place, what
would you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her answer flashed back instantly. &#8220;If I knew
Luck Cullison, I would be sure there was a mistake
somewhere, and I would look for foul play. I
would believe anything except that he was guilty&mdash;anything
in the world. You know he has enemies.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheriff liked her spirited defense no less because
he could not agree with her. &#8220;Yes, I know
that. The trouble is that these incriminating facts
don&#8217;t come in the main from his enemies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You say the robber had on his hat, and that
somebody shot at him. Whoever it was must know
the man wasn&#8217;t father.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gently Bolt took this last prop from her hope.
&#8220;He is almost sure the man was your father.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spark of steel came into her dark eyes. &#8220;Who
is the man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His name is Fendrick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cass Fendrick?&#8221; She whipped the word at
him, leaning forward in her chair rigidly with her
hands clenched on the arms of it. One could have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
guessed that the sound of the name had unleashed
a dormant ferocity in her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I know he and your father aren&#8217;t friends.
They have had some trouble. For that reason
he was very reluctant to give your father&#8217;s
name.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl flamed. &#8220;Reluctant! Don&#8217;t you believe
it? He hates Father like poison.&#8221; A flash of inspiration
came to her. She rose, slim and tall and
purposeful. &#8220;Cass Fendrick is the man you want,
and he is the man I want. He robbed the express
company, and he has killed my father or abducted
him. I know now. Arrest him to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to have evidence,&#8221; Bolt said quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can give you a motive. Listen. Father expected
to prove up yesterday on his Del Oro claim.
If he had done so Cass Fendrick&#8217;s sheep would
have been cut off from the water. Father had to
be got out of the way not later than Wednesday,
or that man would have been put out of business.
He was very bitter about it. He had made threats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would take more than threats to get rid of
the best fighting man in Arizona, right in the middle
of the day, in the heart of the town, without a
soul knowing about it.&#8221; The officer added with a
smile: &#8220;I&#8217;d hate to undertake the contract, give
me all the help I wanted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was trapped somehow, of course,&#8221; Curly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
cut in. For he was sure that in no other way could
Luck Cullison have been overcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll only tell me how, Flandrau,&#8221; Bolt returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how, but we&#8217;ll find out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kate felt his doubt, and it was like a spark to
powder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fendrick is your friend. You were elected by
his influence. Perhaps you want to prove that Father
did this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The people elected me, Miss Cullison,&#8221; answered
Bolt, with grave reproach. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t any
friends or any enemies when it comes to doing what
I&#8217;ve sworn to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you ought to know Father couldn&#8217;t have
done this. There is such a thing as character. Luck
Cullison simply <i>couldn&#8217;t</i> be a thief.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie&#8217;s faith had been strengthened by the
insistent loyalty of the girl. &#8220;That&#8217;s right, Nick.
Let me tell you something else. Fendrick knew
Luck was going to prove up on Thursday. He
heard him tell us at the Round-Up Club Tuesday
morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheriff summed up. &#8220;You&#8217;ve proved Cass
had interests that would be helped if Mr. Cullison
were removed. But you haven&#8217;t shaken the evidence
against Luck.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve proved Cass Fendrick had to get Father
out of the way on the very day he disappeared. One
day later would have been too late. We&#8217;ve shown
his enmity. Any evidence that rests on his word is
no good. The truth isn&#8217;t in the man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe not, but he didn&#8217;t make this evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kate had another inspirational flash. &#8220;He did&mdash;some
of it. Somehow he got hold of father&#8217;s hat,
and he manufactured a story about shooting it from
the robber&#8217;s head. But to make his story stick he
must admit he was on the ground at the time of
the hold-up. So he must have known the robbery
was going to take place. It&#8217;s as plain as old Run-A-Mile&#8217;s
wart that he knew of it because he planned
it himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bolt&#8217;s shrewd eyes narrowed to a smile. &#8220;You
prove to me that Cass had your father&#8217;s hat <i>before
the hold-up</i>, and I&#8217;ll take some stock in the story.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And in the meantime,&#8221; suggested Curly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll keep right on looking for Luck Cullison, but
I&#8217;ll keep an eye on Cass Fendrick, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kate took up the challenge confidently. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
prove he had the hat&mdash;at least I&#8217;ll try to pretty
hard. It&#8217;s the truth, and it must come out somehow.&#8221;</p>
<p>After he had left her at the hotel, Curly walked
the streets with a sharp excitement tingling his
blood. He had lived his life among men, and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
knew little about women and their ways. But his
imagination seized avidly upon this slim, dark girl
with the fine eyes that could be both tender and
ferocious, with the look of combined delicacy and
strength in every line of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t she the gamest little thoroughbred ever?&#8221;
he chuckled to himself. &#8220;Stands the acid every
crack. Think of her standing pat so game&mdash;just
like she did for me that night out at the ranch.
She&#8217;s the best argument Luck has got.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>TWO HATS ON A RACK</h3>
</div>

<p>One casual remark of Mackenzie had given Kate
a clew. Even before she had explained it, Curly
caught the point and began to dig for the truth.
For though he was almost a boy, the others leaned
on him with the expectation that in the absence of
Maloney he would take the lead. Before they separated
for the night he made Mackenzie go over
every detail he could remember of the meeting between
Cullison and Fendrick at the Round-Up
Club. This was the last time the two men had been
seen together in public, and he felt it important
that he should know just what had taken place.</p>
<p>In the morning he and Kate had a talk with his
uncle on the same subject. Not content with this,
he made the whole party adjourn to the club rooms
so that he might see exactly where Luck had sat
and the different places the sheepman had stood
from the time he entered until the poker players
left.</p>
<p>Together Billie Mackenzie and Alec Flandrau
dramatized the scene for the young people. Mac
personated the sheepman, came into the room, hung
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
up his hat, lounged over to the poker table, said
his little piece as well as he could remember it,
and passed into the next room. Flandrau, Senior,
taking the role of Cullison, presently got up, lifted
his hat from the rack, and went to the door.</p>
<p>With excitement trembling in her voice, the girl
asked an eager question. &#8220;Were their hats side by
side like that on adjoining pegs?&#8221;</p>
<p>Billie turned a puzzled face to his friend. &#8220;How
about that, Alec?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how I remember it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Same here, my notion is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Both gray hats?&#8221; Curly cut in.</p>
<p>His uncle looked helplessly at the other man.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t be sure of that. Luck&#8217;s was gray all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cass wore a gray hat too, seems to me,&#8221; Mackenzie
contributed, scratching his gray hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Father hesitate at all about which one to
take?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No-o. I don&#8217;t reckon he did. He had turned
to ask me if I was coming&mdash;wasn&#8217;t looking at the
hats at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly looked at Kate and nodded. &#8220;I reckon we
know how Cass got Mr. Cullison&#8217;s hat. It was left
on the rack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you mean?&#8221; his uncle asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see?&#8221; the girl explained, her eyes
shining with excitement. &#8220;Father took the wrong
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
hat. You know how absent-minded he is sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mackenzie slapped his knee. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet a stack of
blues you&#8217;ve guessed it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a way to make sure,&#8221; Curly said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t get you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fendrick couldn&#8217;t wear Mr. Cullison&#8217;s hat
around without the risk of someone remembering it
later. What would he do then?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kate beamed. &#8220;Buy another at the nearest
store.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be my guess. And the nearest store
is the New York Emporium. We&#8217;ve got to find out
whether he did buy one there on Tuesday some time
after nine o&#8217;clock in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s eyes were sparkling. She bustled with
businesslike energy. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go and ask right away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think we&#8217;d better let Uncle Alec find
out? He&#8217;s not so likely to stir up curiosity,&#8221; Curly
suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Let me earn my board and keep,&#8221;
the owner of the Map of Texas volunteered.</p>
<p>Within a quarter of an hour Alec Flandrau joined
the others at the hotel. He was beaming like a
schoolboy who has been given an unexpected holiday.</p>
<p>&#8220;You kids are right at the head of the class in
the detective game. Cass bought a brown hat,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
about 9:30 in the mo&#8217;ning. Paid five dollars for
it. Wouldn&#8217;t let them deliver the old one but took
it with him in a paper sack.&#8221;</p>
<p>With her lieutenants flanking her Kate went
straight to the office of the sheriff. Bolt heard the
story out and considered it thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;You win, Miss Cullison. You haven&#8217;t proved
Fendrick caused your father&#8217;s disappearance by foul
play, and you haven&#8217;t proved he committed the
robbery. Point of fact I don&#8217;t think he did either
one. But it certainly looks like he may possibly
have manufactured evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly snorted scornfully. &#8220;You&#8217;re letting your
friend down easy, Mr. Bolt. By his own story he
was on the ground a minute after the robbery took
place. How do we know he wasn&#8217;t there a minute
before? For if he didn&#8217;t know the hold-up was
going to occur why did he bring Mr. Cullison&#8217;s
hat with him punctured so neatly with bullet holes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet a thousand dollars he is at the bottom
of this whole thing,&#8221; Mackenzie added angrily.</p>
<p>The sheriff flushed. &#8220;You gentlemen are entitled
to your opinions just as I&#8217;m entitled to mine. You
haven&#8217;t even proved he took Mr. Cullison&#8217;s hat;
you&#8217;ve merely showed he may have done it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve given you a motive and some evidence.
How much more do you want?&#8221; Curly demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold your hawses a while, Flandrau, and look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
at this thing reasonable. You&#8217;re all prejudiced for
Cullison and against Fendrick. Talk about evidence!
There&#8217;s ten times as much against your
friend as there is against Cass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll not arrest Fendrick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you give me good reason to do it,&#8221; Bolt
returned doggedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, Mr. Sheriff. Now we know
where you stand,&#8221; Flandrau, Senior, said stiffly.</p>
<p>The harassed official mopped his face with a
bandanna. &#8220;Sho! You all make me tired. I&#8217;m
not Fendrick&#8217;s friend while I&#8217;m in this office any
more than I&#8217;m Luck&#8217;s, But I&#8217;ve got to use my
judgment, ain&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>The four adjourned to meet at the Del Mar for
a discussion of ways and means.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll keep a watch on Fendrick&mdash;see where he
goes, who he talks to, what he does. Maybe he&#8217;ll
make a break and give himself away,&#8221; Curly said
hopefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;But my father&mdash;we must rescue him first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as we find where he is. Me, I&#8217;m right
hopeful all&#8217;s well with him. Killing him wouldn&#8217;t
help Cass any, because you and Sam would prove
up on the claim. But if he could hold your father
a prisoner and get him to sign a relinquishment to
him he would be in a fine position.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But Father wouldn&#8217;t sign. He ought to know
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not through fear your father wouldn&#8217;t. But
if Fendrick could get at him some way he might
put down his John Hancock. With this trouble of
Sam still unsettled and the Tin Cup hold-up to be
pulled off he might sign.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we could only have Fendrick arrested&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What good would that do? If he&#8217;s guilty he
wouldn&#8217;t talk. And if he is holding your father
somewhere in the hills it would only be serving
notice that we were getting warm. No, I&#8217;m for a
still hunt. Let Cass ride around and meet his partners
in this deal. We&#8217;ll keep an eye on him all
right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re right,&#8221; Kate admitted with a sigh.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>ANONYMOUS LETTERS</h3>
</div>

<p>Sheriff Bolt, though a politician, was an honest
man. It troubled him that Cullison&#8217;s friends believed
him to be a partisan in a matter of this
sort. For which reason he met more than half
way Curly&#8217;s overtures. Young Flandrau was in the
office of the sheriff a good deal, because he wanted
to be kept informed of any new developments in
the W.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;S. robbery case.</p>
<p>It was on one of those occasions that Bolt tossed
across to him a letter he had just opened.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been getting letters from the village cut-up
or from some crank, I don&#8217;t know which. Here&#8217;s
a sample.&#8221;</p>
<p>The envelope, addressed evidently in a disguised
hand, contained one sheet of paper. Upon this
was lettered roughly,</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>&#8220;Play the Jack of Hearts.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Flandrau looked up with a suggestion of eagerness
in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you reckon it means?&#8221; he asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Search me. Like as not it don&#8217;t mean a thing.
The others had just as much sense as that one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see the others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I chucked them into the waste paper basket.
One came by the morning mail yesterday and one
by the afternoon. I&#8217;m no mind reader, and I&#8217;ve got
no time to guess fool puzzles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly observed that the waste paper basket was
full. Evidently it had not been emptied for two
or three days.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mind if I look for the others?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Bolt waved permission. &#8220;Go to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young man emptied the basket on the floor
and went over its contents carefully. He found
three communications from the unknown writer.
Each of them was printed by hand on a sheet of
cheap lined paper torn from a scratch pad. He
smoothed them out and put them side by side on
the table. This was what he read:</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>HEARTS ARE TRUMPS</p>
<p>WHEN IN DOUBT PLAY TRUMPS</p>
<p>PLAY TRUMPS <i>NOW</i></p>
</div>

<p>There was only the one line to each message, and
all of them were plainly in the same hand. He
could make out only one thing, that someone was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
trying to give the sheriff information in a guarded
way.</p>
<p>He was still puzzling over the thing when a boy
came with a special delivery letter for the sheriff.
Bolt glanced at it and handed the note to Curly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another <i>billy doo</i> from my anxious friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>This time the sender had been in too much of
a hurry to print the words. They were written in
a stiff hand by some uneducated person.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>The Jack of Trumps, to-day</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Mind if I keep these?&#8221; Curly asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take &#8217;em along.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flandrau walked out to the grandstand at the
fair grounds and sat down by himself there to think
out what connection, if any, these singular warnings
might have with the vanishing of Cullison or
the robbery of the W.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;S. He wasted three
precious hours without any result. Dusk was falling
before he returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll take them to my little partner and
give her a whack at the puzzle,&#8221; he decided.</p>
<p>Curly strolled back to town along El Molino
street and down Main. He had just crossed the
old Spanish plaza when his absorbed gaze fell on
a sign that brought him up short. In front of a
cigar store stretched across the sidewalk a painted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
picture of a jack of hearts. The same name was on
the window.</p>
<p>Fifty yards behind him was the Silver Dollar
saloon, where Luck Cullison had last been seen on
his way to the Del Mar one hundred and fifty yards
in front of him. Somewhere within that distance
of two hundred yards the owner of the Circle C
had vanished from the sight of men. The evidence
showed he had not reached the hotel, for a cattle
buyer had been waiting there to talk with him.
His testimony, as well as that of the hotel clerk,
was positive.</p>
<p>Could this little store, the Jack of Hearts, be
the central point of the mystery? In his search
for information Curly had already been in it, had
bought a cigar, and had stopped to talk with Mrs.
Wylie, the proprietor. She was a washed-out little
woman who had once been pretty. Habitually she
wore a depressed, hopeless look, the air of pathetic
timidity that comes to some women who have found
life too hard for them. It had been easy to alarm
her. His first question had evidently set her heart
a-flutter, but Flandrau had reassured her cheerfully.
She had protested with absurd earnestness that she
had seen nothing of Mr. Cullison. A single glance
had been enough to dismiss her from any possible
suspicion.</p>
<p>Now Curly stepped in a second time. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
frightened gaze of Mrs. Wylie fastened upon him
instantly. He observed that her hand moved instinctively
to her heart. Beyond question she was
in fear. A flash of light clarified his mind. She
was a conspirator, but an unwilling one. Possibly
she might be the author of the anonymous warnings
sent Bolt.</p>
<p>The young <i>vaquero</i> subscribed for a magazine
and paid her the money. Tremblingly she filled out
the receipt. He glanced at the slip and handed it
back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just write below the signature &#8216;of the Jack of
Hearts,&#8217; so that I&#8217;ll remember where I paid the
money if the magazine doesn&#8217;t come,&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>She did so, and Curly put the receipt in his
pocket carelessly. He sauntered leisurely to the
hotel, but as soon as he could get into a telephone
booth his listlessness vanished. Maloney had returned
to town and he telephoned him to get Mackenzie
at once and watch the Jack of Hearts in
front and rear. Before he left the booth Curly had
compared the writing of Mrs. Wylie with that on
the sheet that had come by special delivery. The
loop of the J&#8217;s, the shape of the K&#8217;s, the formation
of the capital H in both cases were alike. So
too was the general lack of character common to
both, the peculiar hesitating drag of the letters.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
Beyond question the same person had written both.</p>
<p>Certainly Mrs. Wylie was not warning the sheriff
against herself. Then against whom? He must
know her antecedents, and at once. There was no
time for him to mole them out himself. Calling
up a local detective agency, he asked the manager
to let him know within an hour or two all that
could be found out about the woman without alarming
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a moment I think we have her on file.
Hold the &#8217;phone.&#8221; The detective presently returned.
&#8220;Yes. We can give you the facts. Will you come
to the office for them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later Curly knew that Mrs. Wylie
was the divorced wife of Lute Blackwell. She had
come to Saguache from the mountains several years
before. Soon after there had been an inconspicuous
notice in the <i>Sentinel</i> to the effect that Cora Blackwell
was suing for divorce from Lute Blackwell,
then a prisoner in the penitentiary at Yuma. Another
news item followed a week later stating that
the divorce had been granted together with the
right to use her maiden name. Unobtrusively she
had started her little store. Her former husband,
paroled from the penitentiary a few months before
the rustling episode, had at intervals made of her
shop a loafing place since that time.</p>
<p>Curly returned to the Del Mar and sent his name
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
up to Miss Cullison. With Kate and Bob there was
also in the room Alec Flandrau.</p>
<p>The girl came forward lightly to meet him with
the lance-straight poise that always seemed to him
to express a brave spirit ardent and unafraid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you heard something?&#8221; she asked quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Tell me, when did your father last meet
Lute Blackwell so far as you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Not for years, I think. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>The owner of the Map of Texas answered the
question of his nephew. &#8220;He met him the other
day. Let&#8217;s see. It was right after the big poker
game. We met him downstairs here. Luck had
to straighten out some notions he had got.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>Flandrau, Senior, told the story of what had occurred
in the hotel lobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you say he swore to get even?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what he said. And he looked like he
meant it too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it? What have you found out?&#8221; Kate
implored.</p>
<p>The young man told about the letters and Mrs.
Wylie.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get a move on us,&#8221; he concluded.
&#8220;For if Lute Blackwell did this thing to your father
it&#8217;s mighty serious for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kate was white to the lips, but in no danger of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
breaking down. &#8220;Yes, if this man is in it he would
not stop at less than murder. But I don&#8217;t believe it.
I know Father is alive. Cass Fendrick is the man
we want. I&#8217;m sure of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly had before seen women hard as nails, gaunt
strong mountaineers as tough as hickory withes.
But he had never before seen that quality dwelling
in a slim girlish figure of long soft curves, never
seen it in a face of dewy freshness that could melt
to the tenderest pity. She was like flint, and yet
she could give herself with a passionate tenderness
to those she loved. He had seen animals guard their
young with that same alert eager abandon. His
conviction was that she would gladly die for her
father if it were necessary. As he looked at her
with hard unchanging eyes, his blood quickened to
a fierce joy in her it had known for no other woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;First thing is to search the Jack of Hearts and
see what&#8217;s there. Are you with me, Uncle Alec?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure am, Curly;&#8221; and he reached for his hat.</p>
<p>Bob too was on his feet. &#8220;I&#8217;m going. You
needn&#8217;t any of you say I ain&#8217;t, for I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly nodded. &#8220;If you&#8217;ll do as you&#8217;re told, Bob.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will. Cross my heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May I come too?&#8221; Kate pleaded.</p>
<p>She was a strongwilled impulsive young woman,
and her deference to Curly flattered him; but he
shook his head none the less.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No. You may wait in the parlor downstairs
and I&#8217;ll send Bob to you with any news. There&#8217;s
just a chance this may be a man&#8217;s job and we want
to go to it unhampered.&#8221; He turned at the door
with his warm smile. &#8220;By the way, I&#8217;ve got some
news I forgot. I know where your father got the
money to pay his poker debts. Mr. Jordan of the
Cattlemen&#8217;s National made him a personal loan.
He figured it would not hurt the bank because the
three men Luck paid it to would deposit it with the
bank again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By George, that&#8217;s what we did, too, every last
one of us,&#8221; his uncle admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every little helps,&#8221; Kate said; and her little
double nod thanked Curly.</p>
<p>The young man stopped a moment after the
others had gone. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to let Bob get
into danger,&#8221; he promised.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew you wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; was her confident answer.</p>
<p>At the corner of the plaza Curly gave Bob instructions.</p>
<p>&#8220;You stay here and keep an eye on everyone that
passes. Don&#8217;t try to stop anybody. Just size them
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t I to go with you? I got a gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re to do as I say. What kind of a soldier
would you make if you can&#8217;t obey orders? I&#8217;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
running this. If you don&#8217;t like it trot along home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll stay,&#8221; agreed the crestfallen youth.</p>
<p>Maloney met them in front of the Jack of Hearts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dick, you go with me inside. Uncle Alec, will
you keep guard outside?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, bub, I won&#8217;t. I knew Luck before you were
walking bowlegged,&#8221; the old cattleman answered
brusquely.</p>
<p>Curly grinned. &#8220;All right. Don&#8217;t blame me if
you get shot up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wylie&#8217;s startled eyes told tales when she
saw the three men. Her face was ashen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here to play trumps, Mrs. Wylie. What
secret has the Jack of Hearts got hidden from us?&#8221;
young Flandrau demanded, his hard eyes fastened to
her timorous ones.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know what you mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No use. We&#8217;re here for business. Dick, you
stay with her. Don&#8217;t let her leave or shout a warning.&#8221;</p>
<p>He passed into the back room, which was a kind
of combination living room, kitchen and bedroom.
A door led from the rear into a back yard littered
with empty packing cases, garbage cans and waste
paper. After taking a look around the yard he
locked the back door noiselessly. There was no
other apparent exit from the kitchen-bedroom except
the one by which he and his uncle had entered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
from the shop. But he knew the place must have
a cellar, and his inspection of the yard had showed
no entrance there. He drew back the Navajo rug
that covered the floor and found one of the old-fashioned
trap doors some cheap houses have. Into
this was fitted an iron ring with which to lift it.</p>
<p>From the darkness below came no sound, but
Curly&#8217;s imagination conceived the place as full of
shining eyes glaring up at him. Any bad men
down there already had the drop on them. Therefore
neither Curly nor his uncle made the mistake
of drawing a weapon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming down, boys,&#8221; young Flandrau announced
in a quiet confident voice. &#8220;The place is
surrounded by our friends and it won&#8217;t do you a
whole lot of good to shoot me up. I&#8217;d advise you
not to be too impulsive&#8221;</p>
<p>He descended the steps, his face like a stone wall
for all the emotion it recorded. At his heels came
the older man. Curly struck a match, found an
electric bulb above his head, and turned the button.
Instantly the darkness was driven from the cellar.</p>
<p>The two Flandraus were quite alone in the room.
For furniture there was a table, a cot which had
been slept in and not made up, and a couple of
rough chairs. The place had no windows, no means
of ventilation except through the trap door. Yet
there were evidences to show that it had recently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
been inhabited. Half smoked cigars littered the
floor. A pack of cards lay in disorder on the table.
The <i>Sentinel</i> with date line of that day lay tossed
in a corner.</p>
<p>The room told Curly this at least: There had
been a prisoner here with a guard or guards.
Judging by the newspaper they had been here within
a few hours. The time of sending the special delivery
letter made this the more probable. He had
missed the men he wanted by a very little time.
If he had had the gumption to understand the hints
given by the letters Cullison might now be eating
supper with his family at the hotel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Make anything out of it?&#8221; the older Flandrau
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been here, but they&#8217;ve taken him away.
Will you cover the telephoning? Have all the
ranches notified that Luck is being taken into the
hills so they can picket the trails.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know he is being taken there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I guess. Blackwell is in it. He
knows every nook of the hills. The party left here
not two hours since, looks like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly put the newspaper in his pocket and led the
Way back to the store.</p>
<p>&#8220;The birds have flown, Dick, Made their getaway
through the alley late this afternoon, probably
just after it got dark.&#8221; He turned to the woman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
&#8220;Mrs. Wylie, murder is going to be done, I
shouldn&#8217;t wonder. And you&#8217;re liable to be held
guilty of it unless you tell us all you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>She began to weep, helplessly, but with a sort
of stubbornness too. Frightened she certainly was,
but some greater fear held her silent as to the
secret. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about it,&#8221; she repeated
over and over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t do. You&#8217;ve got to speak. A man&#8217;s life
hangs on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But his resolution could not break hers, incomparably
stronger than she though he was. Her
conscience had driven her to send veiled warnings
to the sheriff. But for very fear of her life she
dared not commit herself openly.</p>
<p>Maloney had an inspiration. He spoke in a low
voice to Curly. &#8220;Let&#8217;s take her to the hotel. Miss
Kate will know how to get it out of her better than
we can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wylie went with them quietly enough. She
was shaken with fears but still resolute not to speak.
They might send her to prison. She would tell
them nothing&mdash;nothing at all. For someone who
had made terror the habit of her life had put the
fear of death into her soul.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>A MESSAGE IN CIPHER</h3>
</div>

<p>While Kate listened to what Curly had to tell her
the dark eyes of the girl were fastened upon the
trembling little woman standing near the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean that she is going to let my father
be killed rather than tell what she knows?&#8221; Her
voice was sharply incredulous, touched with a horror
scarcely realized.</p>
<p>&#8220;So she says.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wylie wrung her hands in agitation. Her
lined face was a mirror of distress.</p>
<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s impossible. She must tell. What has
Father ever done to hurt her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know anything about it,&#8221; the harassed
woman iterated.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of saying that when we know
you do? And you&#8217;ll not get out of it by sobbing.
You&#8217;ve <i>got</i> to talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kate had not moved. None the less her force,
the upblaze of feminine energy in her, crowded the
little storekeeper to the wall. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to tell&mdash;you&#8217;ve
just got to,&#8221; she insisted.</p>
<p>The little woman shrank before the energy of a
passion so vital. No strength was in her to fight.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
But she could and did offer the passive resistance
of obstinate silence.</p>
<p>Curly had drawn from his pocket the newspaper
found in the cellar. His eyes had searched for the
date line to use as cumulative evidence, but they
had remained fastened to one story. Now he spoke
imperatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come here, Miss Kate.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was beside him in an instant. &#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure yet, but&mdash;&mdash; Look here. I believe
this is a message to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A message?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From your father perhaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How could it be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I found the paper in the cellar where he was.
See how some of these words are scored. Done
with a finger nail, looks like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how could he know we would see the paper,
and if we did see it would understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He couldn&#8217;t. It would be one chance in a million,
but all his life he&#8217;s been taking chances. This
couldn&#8217;t do any harm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her dark head bent beside his fair one with the
crisp sun-reddened curls.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any message. Where is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see it myself&mdash;not much of it. Gimme
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was the paragraph upon which his gaze had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
fastened, and the words and letters were scored
sharply as shown below, though in the case of single
letters the mark ran through them instead of underneath,
evidently that no mistake might be made as
to which was meant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you make it out?&#8221; Maloney asked, looking
over their shoulders.</p>
<p>Curly took a pencil and an envelope from his
pocket. On the latter he jotted down some words
and handed the paper to his friend. This was what
Maloney read:</p>
<p style='font-family: monospace; margin-left: 4em'>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Read that right ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dick did not quite get the idea, but Kate, tense
with excitement, took the envelope and read aloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Luck&mdash;&mdash;prisoner&mdash;&mdash;Jack of Hearts&mdash;&mdash;now
Saguache&mdash;&mdash;locked up pending a disposition of
his case&mdash;&mdash;succeeded in surprising him.&#8221; She
looked up with shining eyes. &#8220;He tells us everything
but the names of the people who did it. Perhaps
somewhere else in the paper he may tell that
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>But though they went over it word for word they
found no more. Either he had been interrupted,
or he had been afraid that his casual thumb nail
pressures might arouse the suspicion of his guards
if persisted in too long.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s alive somewhere. We&#8217;ll save him now.&#8221;
Kate cried it softly, all warm with the joy of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to let our friend Fendrick out,&#8221; Maloney
mused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lets him out of kidnapping Uncle Luck but
maybe not out of the robbery,&#8221; Bob amended.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t let him out of either. Somebody was
in this with Blackwell. If it wasn&#8217;t Cass Fendrick
then who was it?&#8221; Kate wanted to know.</p>
<p>&#8220;Might have been Soapy Stone,&#8221; Dick guessed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Might have been, but now Sam has gone back
into the hills to join Soapy; the gang would have
to keep it from Sam. He wouldn&#8217;t stand for it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, not for a minute,&#8221; Kate said decisively.</p>
<p>Curly spoke to her in a low voice. &#8220;You have
a talk with Mrs. Wylie alone. We&#8217;ll pull our
freights. She&#8217;ll tell you what she knows.&#8221; He
smiled in his gentle winning way. &#8220;She&#8217;s sure had
a tough time of it if ever a woman had. I reckon
a little kindness is what she needs. Let her see
we&#8217;re her friends and will stand by her, that we
won&#8217;t let her come to harm because she talks. Show
her we know everything anyhow but want her to
corroborate details.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was an hour before Kate joined them, and
her eyes, though they were very bright, told tales,
of tears that had been shed.</p>
<p>&#8220;That poor woman! She has told me everything.
Father has been down in that cellar for days under
a guard. They took him away to-night. She
doesn&#8217;t know where. It was she sent the warnings
to Sheriff Bolt. She wanted him to raid the place,
but she dared not go to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of Blackwell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He came straight to her as soon as he
was freed from the penitentiary. He had her completely
terrorized. It seems she has been afraid to
draw a deep breath ever since he returned. Even
while he was in the hills she was always looking
for him to come. The man used to keep her in
a hell and he began bullying her again. So she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
gave him money, and he came for more&mdash;and
more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly nodded. He said nothing, but his strong
jaw clamped.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was there that day,&#8221; the girl continued.
&#8220;She plucked up courage to refuse him what little
she had left because she needed it for the rent. He
got hold of her arm and twisted it. Father heard
her cry and came in. Blackwell was behind the
door as it opened. He struck with a loaded cane
and Father fell unconscious. He raised it to strike
again, but she clung to his arm and called for help.
Before he could shake her off another man came
in. He wrenched the club away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fendrick?&#8221; breathed Curly.</p>
<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t know. But the first thing he did
was to lock the outer door and take the key. They
carried Father down into the cellar. Before he
came to himself his hands were tied behind his
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They watched him day and night. Fendrick
himself did not go near the place&mdash;if it was Fendrick.
Blackwell swore to kill Mrs. Wylie if she
told. They held him there till to-night. She thinks
they were trying to get Father to sign some paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The relinquishment of course. That means the
other man was Fendrick.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>Kate nodded. &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curly rose. The muscles stood out in his jaw;
hard as steel ropes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll rake the Rincons with a fine tooth comb.
Don&#8217;t you worry. I&#8217;ve already wired for Bucky
O&#8217;Connor to come and help. We&#8217;ll get your Father
out of the hands of those hell hounds. Won&#8217;t we,
Dick?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s eyes admired him, a lean hard-bitten
Westerner with eyes as unblinking as an Arizona
sun and with muscles like wire springs. His face
still held its boyishness, but it had lost forever the
irresponsibility of a few months before. She saw
in him an iron will, shrewdness, courage and resource.
All of these his friend Maloney also had.
But Curly was the prodigal son, the sinner who had
repented. His engaging recklessness lent him a
charm from which she could not escape. Out of ten
thousand men there were none whose voice drummed
on her heart strings as did that of this youth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>&#8220;THE FRIENDS OF L.&nbsp;C. SERVE NOTICE&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>Two men sat in a log cabin on opposite sides
of a cheap table. One of them was immersed in a
newspaper. His body was relaxed, his mind apparently
at ease. The other watched him malevolently.
His fingers caressed the handle of a revolver
that protruded from the holster at his side.
He would have liked nothing better than to have
drawn it and sent a bullet crashing into the unperturbed
brain of his prisoner.</p>
<p>There were reasons of policy why it were better
to curb this fascinating desire, but sometimes the
impulse to kill surged up almost uncontrollably. On
these occasions Luck Cullison was usually &#8220;deviling&#8221;
him, the only diversion that had been open to
the ranchman for some days past. Because of its
danger&mdash;for he could never be quite sure that
Blackwell&#8217;s lust for swift vengeance would not over-power
discretion&mdash;this pastime made a peculiar
appeal to the audacious temper of the owner of
the Circle C.</p>
<p>From time to time as Luck read he commented
genially on the news.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I see Tucson is going to get the El Paso &amp;
Southwestern extension after all. I&#8217;ll bet the boys
in that burg will be right tickled to hear it. They
sure have worked steady for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blackwell merely scowled. He never relaxed to
the give and take of casual talk with his captive.
Given his way, Cullison would not be here to read
the <i>Sentinel</i>. But the brains of the conspiracy had
ruled otherwise and had insisted too upon decent
treatment. With one ankle securely tied to a leg
of the table there was no danger in freeing the
hands of the cattleman, but his hosts saw that never
for an instant were hands and feet at liberty together.
For this man was not the one with whom
to take chances.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rudd has been convicted of forgery and taken
to Yuma. Seems to me you used to live there,
didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; asked the cattleman with cool insolence,
looking up from his paper to smile across at
the furious convict.</p>
<p>Blackwell was livid. The man who had sent him
to the territorial prison at Yuma dared to sit there
bound and unarmed and taunt him with it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take care,&#8221; he advised hoarsely.</p>
<p>Cullison laughed and went back to the paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Lieutenant O&#8217;Connor of the Arizona Rangers
left town to-day for a short trip into the hills where
he expects to spend a few days hunting.&#8217; Hunting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
what, do you reckon? Or hunting who, I should
say. Ever meet Bucky O&#8217;Connor, Blackwell? No,
I reckon not. He&#8217;s since your time. A crackerjack
too! Wonder if Bucky ain&#8217;t after some friends of
mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up,&#8221; growled the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure you&#8217;ll be shut up&mdash;when Bucky lands you,&#8221;
retorted Luck cheerfully. Then, with a sudden
whoop: &#8220;Hello, here&#8217;s a personal to your address.
Fine! They&#8217;re getting ready to round you up, my
friend. Listen. &#8216;The friends of L.&nbsp;C. serve notice
that what occurred at the Jack of Hearts is known.
Any violence hereafter done to him will be paid for
to the limit. No guilty man will escape.&#8217; So the
boys are getting busy. I figured they would be.
Looks like your chance of knocking me on the head
has gone down Salt River. I tell you nowadays a
man has to grab an opportunity by the tail when it&#8217;s
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The former convict leaned forward angrily.
&#8220;Lemme see that paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>His guest handed it over, an index finger pointing
out the item. &#8220;Large as life, Blackwell. No,
sir. You ce&#8217;tainly didn&#8217;t ride herd proper on that
opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too sure it&#8217;s gone, Mr. Sheriff.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s face was twisted to an ugly sneer back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
of which lurked cruel menace. The gray eyes of
Cullison did not waver a hair&#8217;s breadth.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gone. I&#8217;m as safe as if I were at the Circle
C.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got you dead to rights. Read that personal
again. Learn it by heart. &#8216;The friends of
L.&nbsp;C. give warning.&#8217; You better believe they&#8217;re
rounding up your outfit. They know I&#8217;m alive.
They know all about the Jack of Hearts. Pretty
soon they&#8217;ll know where you&#8217;ve got me hidden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better pray they won&#8217;t. For if they find
the nest it will be empty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; Luck spoke with ironical carelessness, but
he shot an alert keen glance at the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I said. Want to know where you
will be?&#8221; the other triumphed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you want to tell me. Unload your mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Triumph overrode discretion. &#8220;Look out of that
window behind you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luck turned. The cabin was built on a ledge far
up on the mountain side. From the back wall sloped
for a hundred feet an almost perpendicular slide of
rock.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a prospect hole down there,&#8221; Blackwell
explained savagely. &#8220;You&#8217;d go down the Devil&#8217;s
Slide&mdash;what&#8217;s left of you, I mean&mdash;deep into that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
prospect hole. The timberings are rotted and the
whole top of the working ready to cave in. When
your body hits it there will be an avalanche&mdash;with
Mr. Former-sheriff Cullison at the bottom of it.
You&#8217;ll be buried without any funeral expenses, and
I reckon your friends will never know where to
put the headstone.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thing was devilishly simple and feasible.
Luck, still looking out of the window, felt the blood
run cold down his spine, for he knew this fellow
would never stick at murder if he felt it would be
safe. No doubt he was being well paid, and though
in this workaday world revenge has gone out of
fashion there was no denying that this ruffian would
enjoy evening the score. But his confederate was
of another stripe, a human being with normal passions
and instincts. The cattleman wondered how
he could reconcile it to his conscience to go into so
vile a plot with a villain like the convict.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you see I&#8217;m right; you&#8217;d better pray your
friends <i>won&#8217;t</i> find you. They can&#8217;t reach here without
being heard. If they get to hunting these hills
you sure want to hope they&#8217;ll stay cold, for just as
soon as they get warm it will be the signal for you
to shoot the chutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luck met his triumphant savagery with an impassive
face. &#8220;Interesting if true. And where will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
you be when my friends arrive. I reckon it won&#8217;t
be a pleasant meeting for Mr. Blackwell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be headed for Mexico. I tell you because
you ain&#8217;t liable to go around spreading the news.
There&#8217;s a horse saddled in the dip back of the hill
crest. Get it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; Cullison came back. &#8220;And you&#8217;ll ride
right into some of Bucky O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s rangers. He&#8217;s
got the border patroled. You&#8217;d never make it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;d slip through. I&#8217;m no tenderfoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What if you did? Bucky would drag you back
by the scruff of the neck in two weeks. Remember
Chavez.&#8221;</p>
<p>He referred to a murderer whom the lieutenant
of rangers had captured and brought back to be
hanged later.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chavez was a fool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was he? You don&#8217;t get the point. The old
days are gone. Law is in the saddle. Murder is
no longer a pleasant pastime.&#8221; And Cullison
stretched his arms and yawned.</p>
<p>From far below there came through the open
window the faint click of a horse&#8217;s hoofs ringing
against the stones in the dry bed of a river wash.
Swiftly Blackwell moved to the door, taking down
a rifle from its rack as he did so. Cullison rose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
noiselessly in his chair. If it came to the worst he
meant to shout aloud his presence and close with
this fellow. Hampered as he was by the table,
the man would get him without question. But if
he could only sink his fingers into that hairy throat
while there was still life in him he could promise
that the Mexican trip would never take place.</p>
<p>Blackwell, from his place by the door, could keep
an eye both on his prisoner and on a point of the
trail far below where horsemen must pass to reach
the cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; he ordered.</p>
<p>Cullison&#8217;s eyes were like finely-tempered steel.
&#8220;I&#8217;d rather stand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By God, if you move from there&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; The man
did not finish his sentence, but the rifle was already
half lifted. More words would have been superfluous.</p>
<p>A rider came into sight and entered the mouth
of the cañon. He was waving a white handkerchief.
The man in the doorway answered the signal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not your friends this time, Mr. Sheriff,&#8221; Blackwell
jeered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I get a stay of execution, do I?&#8221; The cool
drawling voice of the cattleman showed nothing of
the tense feeling within.</p>
<p>He resumed his seat and the reading of the newspaper.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
Presently, to the man that came over the
threshold he spoke with a casual nod.</p>
<p>&#8220;Morning, Cass.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fendrick mumbled a surly answer. The manner
of ironical comradeship his captive chose to employ
was more than an annoyance. To serve his ends
it was necessary to put the fear of death into this
man&#8217;s heart, which was a thing he had found impossible
to do. His foe would deride him, joke
with him, discuss politics with him, play cards with
him, do anything but fear him. In the meantime
the logic of circumstances was driving the sheepman
into a corner. He had on impulse made the
owner of the Circle C his prisoner. Seeing him
lie there unconscious on the floor of the Jack of
Hearts, it had come to him in a flash that he might
hold him and force a relinquishment of the Del
Oro claim. His disappearance would explain itself
if the rumor spread that he was the W.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;S. express
robber. Cass had done it to save himself from the
ruin of his business, but already he had regretted
it fifty times. Threats could not move Luck in the
least. He was as hard as iron.</p>
<p>So the sheepman found himself between the upper
and the nether millstones. He could not drive his
prisoner to terms and he dared not release him.
For if Cullison went away unpledged he would
surely send him to the penitentiary. Nor could he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
hold him a prisoner indefinitely. He had seen the
&#8220;personal&#8221; warning in both the morning and the
afternoon papers. He guessed that the presence
of the ranger Bucky O&#8217;Connor in Saguache was not
a chance. The law was closing in on him. Somehow
Cullison must be made to come through with
a relinquishment and a pledge not to prosecute.
The only other way out would be to let Blackwell
wreak his hate on the former sheriff. From this he
shrank with every instinct. Fendrick was a hard
man. He would have fought it out to a finish if
necessary. But murder was a thing he could not do.</p>
<p>He had never discussed the matter with Blackwell.
The latter had told him of this retreat in the
mountains and they had brought their prisoner here.
But the existence of the prospect hole at the foot
of the Devil&#8217;s Slide was unknown to him. From
the convict&#8217;s revenge he had hitherto saved Luck.
Blackwell was his tool rather than his confederate,
but he was uneasily aware that if the man yielded
to the elemental desire to kill his enemy the law,
would hold him, Cass Fendrick, guilty of the crime.</p>
<p>&#8220;Price of sheep good this week?&#8221; Cullison asked
amiably.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t come here to discuss the price of sheep
with you.&#8221; Fendrick spoke harshly. A dull anger
against the scheme of things burned in him. For
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
somehow he had reached an <i>impasse</i> from which
there was neither advance nor retreat.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Well, you&#8217;re right there. What I don&#8217;t
know about sheep would fill several government reports.
Of course I&#8217;ve got ideas. One of them
is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care anything about your ideas. Are
you going to sign this relinquishment?&#8221;</p>
<p>Luck&#8217;s face showed a placid surprise. &#8220;Why no,
Cass. Thought I mentioned that before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better.&#8221; The sheepman&#8217;s harassed face
looked ugly enough for anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t figure it out that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to sign it. By God, you&#8217;ve no option.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; Still with pleasant incredulity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think I&#8217;m going to let you get away from here
now. You&#8217;ll sign and you&#8217;ll promise to tell nothing
you know against us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t reckon I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cullison was looking straight at him with his
fearless level gaze. Fendrick realized with a sinking
heart that he could not drive him that way to
surrender. He knew that in the other man&#8217;s place
he would have given way, that his enemy was gamer
than he was.</p>
<p>He threw up his hand in a sullen gesture that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
disclaimed responsibility. &#8220;All right. It&#8217;s on your
own head. I&#8217;ve done all I can for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s on my head?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your life. Damn you, don&#8217;t you see you&#8217;re
driving me too far?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How far?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to let you get away to send us
to prison. What do you expect?&#8221;</p>
<p>Luck&#8217;s frosty eyes did not release the other for
a moment. &#8220;How are you going to prevent it,
Cass?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll find a way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blackwell&#8217;s way&mdash;the Devil&#8217;s Slide?&#8221;</p>
<p>The puzzled look of the sheepman told Cullison
that Blackwell&#8217;s plan of exit for him had not been
submitted to the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your friend from Yuma has been explaining
how he has arranged for me to cross the divide,&#8221;
he went on. &#8220;I&#8217;m to be plugged full of lead, shot
down that rock, and landed in a prospect hole at
the bottom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;First I&#8217;ve heard of it.&#8221; Fendrick wheeled upon
his accomplice with angry eyes. He was in general
a dominant man, and not one who would stand
much initiative from his assistants.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s always deviling me,&#8221; complained the convict
surlily. Then, with a flash of anger: &#8220;But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
I stand pat. He&#8217;ll get his before I take chances
of getting caught. I&#8217;m nobody&#8217;s fool.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cass snapped him up. &#8220;You&#8217;ll do as I say.
You&#8217;ll not lift a finger against him unless he tries
to escape.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you seen the <i>Sentinel</i>? I tell you his
friends know everything. Someone&#8217;s peached.
They&#8217;re hot on our trail. Bucky O&#8217;Connor is in
the hills. Think I&#8217;m going to be caught like a rat
in a trap?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll talk of that later. Now you go look
after my horse while I keep guard here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blackwell went, protesting that he was no
&#8220;nigger&#8221; to be ordered about on errands. As soon,
as he was out of hearing Fendrick turned his thin
lip-smile on the prisoner.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s up to you, Cullison. I saved your life once.
I&#8217;m protecting you now. But if your friends show
up he&#8217;ll do as he says. I won&#8217;t be here to stop him.
Sign up and don&#8217;t be a fool.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luck&#8217;s answer came easily and lightly. &#8220;My
friend, we&#8217;ve already discussed that point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t change your mind?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your arguments don&#8217;t justify it, Cass.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheepman looked at him with a sinister significance.
&#8220;Good enough. I&#8217;ll bring you one that
will justify it <i>muy pronto</i>.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It will have to be a mighty powerful one. Sorry
I can&#8217;t oblige you and your friend, the convict.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be powerful enough.&#8221; Fendrick went to
the door and called Blackwell. &#8220;Bring back that
horse. I&#8217;m going down to the valley.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>CASS FENDRICK MAKES A CALL</h3>
</div>

<p>Kate was in her rose garden superintending the
stable boy as he loosened the dirt around the roots
of some of the bushes. She had returned to the
Circle C for a day or two to give some directions
in the absence of her father. Buck and the other
riders came to her for orders and took them without
contempt. She knew the cattle business, and
they knew she knew it. To a man they were proud
of her, of her spirit, her energy, and her good looks.</p>
<p>This rose garden was one evidence of her enterprise.
No ranch in the county could show such a
riot of bloom as the Circle C. The American
Beauty, the Duchess, the La France bowed gracefully
to neighbors of a dozen other choice varieties.
Kate had brought this glimpse of Eden into the
desert. She knew her catalogues by heart and she
had the loving instinct that teaches all gardeners
much about growing things.</p>
<p>The rider who cantered up to the fence, seeing
her in her well-hung corduroy skirt, her close-fitting
blouse, and the broad-rimmed straw hat that shielded
her dark head from the sun, appreciated the fitness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
of her surroundings. She too was a flower of the
desert, delicately fashioned, yet vital with the bloom
of health.</p>
<p>At the clatter of hoofs she looked up from the
bush she was trimming and at once rose to her
feet. With the change in position she showed slim
and tall, straight as a young poplar. Beneath their
long lashes her eyes grew dark and hard. For
the man who had drawn to a halt was Cass Fendrick.</p>
<p>From the pocket of his shirt he drew a crumpled
piece of stained linen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve brought back your handkerchief, Miss Cullison.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you done with my father?&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded toward the Mexican boy and Kate
dismissed the lad. When he had gone she asked
her question again in exactly the same words.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we&#8217;re going to discuss your father you had
better get your quirt again,&#8221; the sheepman suggested,
touching a scar on his face.</p>
<p>A flush swept over her cheeks, but she held her
voice quiet and even. &#8220;Where is Father? What
have you done with him?&#8221;</p>
<p>He swung from the horse and threw the rein to
the ground. Then, sauntering to the gate, he let
himself in.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve surely got a nice posy garden here.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
Didn&#8217;t know there was one like it in all sunbaked
Arizona.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stood rigid. Her unfaltering eyes, sloe-black
in the pale face, never lifted from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one thing you can talk to me about
Where have you hidden my father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard folks say he did himself all the hiding
that was done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know that isn&#8217;t true. That convict and
you have hidden him somewhere. We have evidence
enough to convict you both.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagination, most of it, I expect.&#8221; He was inspecting
the roses and inhaling their bloom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fact enough to send you to the penitentiary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to be scared. This is a La France, ain&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to tell me what you have done with
my father.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed a little and looked at her with eyes
that narrowed like those of a cat basking in the
sun. He had something the look of the larger
members of the cat family&mdash;the soft long tread, the
compact rippling muscles of a tame panther, and
with these the threat that always lies behind its
sleepy wariness.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a young lady of one idea. No use arguing
with you, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not the least use. I&#8217;ve talked with Mrs. Wylie.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>He raised his eyebrows. &#8220;Do I know the lady?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She will know you. That is more to the point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did she say she knew me?&#8221; he purred.</p>
<p>&#8220;She will say it in court&mdash;if it ever comes to
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what will she say, if you please.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kate told him in four sentences with a stinging
directness that was the outstanding note of her,
that and a fine self-forgetful courage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all? Comes to this then, that she says
I heard her scream, ran in, and saved your father&#8217;s
life. Is that a penitentiary offense? I don&#8217;t say
it oughtn&#8217;t to be, but is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You helped the villain take his body into the
cellar. You plotted with him to hold Father a
prisoner there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Says that, does she&mdash;that she overheard us
plotting?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course she did not overhear what you said.
You took good care of that. But she knew you
were conspiring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just naturally knew it without overhearing,&#8221; he
derided. &#8220;And of course if I was in a plot I must
have been Johnny-on-the-spot a good deal of the
time. Hung round there a-plenty, I expect?&#8221;</p>
<p>He had touched on the weak spot of Mrs. Wylie&#8217;s
testimony. The man who had saved Cullison&#8217;s life,
after a long talk with Blackwell, had gone out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
the Jack of Hearts and had not returned so far as
she knew. For her former husband had sent her
on an errand just before the prisoner was taken
away and she did not know who had helped him.</p>
<p>Kate was silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;How would this do for an explanation?&#8221; he
suggested lazily. &#8220;We&#8217;ll say just for the sake of
argument that Mrs. Wylie&#8217;s story is true, that I did
save your father&#8217;s life. We&#8217;ll put it that I did help
carry him downstairs where it was cooler and that
I did have a long talk with the fellow Blackwell.
What would I be talking to him about, if I wasn&#8217;t
reading the riot act to him? Ain&#8217;t it likely too
that he would be sorry for what he did while he
was angry at your father for butting in as he was
having trouble with his wife? And after he had
said he was sorry why shouldn&#8217;t I hit the road out
of there? There&#8217;s no love lost between me and
Luck Cullison. I wasn&#8217;t under any obligations to
wrap him up in cotton and bring him back this side
up with care to his anxious friends. If he chose
later to take a hike out of town on p.d.q. hurry
up business I ain&#8217;t to blame. And I reckon you&#8217;ll
find a jury will agree with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had to admit to herself that he made out a
plausible case. Not that she believed it for a moment.
But very likely a jury would. As for his
subsequent silence that could be explained by his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
desire not to mix himself in the affairs of one with
whom he was upon unfriendly terms. The irrefutable
fact that he had saved the life of Cullison
would go a long way as presumptive proof of his
innocence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you are wearing your gray hat again?
What have you done with the brown one?&#8221;</p>
<p>She had flashed the question at him so unexpectedly
that he was startled, but the wary mask
fell again over the sardonic face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You take a right friendly interest in my hats,
seems to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know this much. Father took your hat by
mistake from the club. You bought a brown one
half an hour later. You used Father&#8217;s to manufacture
evidence against him. If it isn&#8217;t true that he
is your prisoner how does it come that you have
your gray hat again? You must have taken it from
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed uneasily. She had guessed the exact
truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Arizona there are about forty thousand gray
hats like this. Do you figure you can identify this
one, Miss Cullison? And suppose your fairy tale
of the Jack of Hearts is true, couldn&#8217;t I have
swapped hats again while he lay there unconscious?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>She brushed his explanation aside with a woman&#8217;s
superb indifference to logic.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can talk of course. I don&#8217;t care. It is
all lies&mdash;lies. You have kidnapped Father and are
holding him somewhere. Don&#8217;t you dare to hurt
him. If you should&mdash;Oh, if you should&mdash;you will
wish you had never been born.&#8221; The fierceness of
her passion beat upon him like sudden summer
hail.</p>
<p>He laughed slowly, well pleased. A lazy smoldering
admiration shone in his half shuttered eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re going to take it out of me, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>A creature of moods, there came over her now a
swift change. Every feature of her, the tense pose,
the manner of defiant courage, softened indescribably.
She was no longer an enemy bent on his destruction
but a girl pleading for the father she loved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you do it? You are a man. You want
to fight fair. Tell me he is well. Tell me you will
set him free.&#8221;</p>
<p>He forgot for the moment that he was a man
with the toils of the law closing upon him, forgot
that his success and even his liberty were at stake.
He saw only a girl with the hunger of love in her
wistful eyes, and knew that it lay in his power to
bring back the laughter and the light into them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose I can&#8217;t fight fair any longer. Suppose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
I&#8217;ve let myself get trapped and it isn&#8217;t up to me but
to somebody else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Up to your father, say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. How could I turn him loose when the first
thing he did would be to swear out a warrant for
my arrest?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he wouldn&#8217;t&mdash;not if you freed him.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed harshly. &#8220;I thought you knew him.
He&#8217;s hard as nails.&#8221;</p>
<p>She recognized the justice of this appraisal. &#8220;But
he is generous too. He stands by his friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not his friend, not so you could notice it.&#8221;
He laughed again, bitterly. &#8220;Not that it matters.
Of course I was just putting a case. Nothing to
it really.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was hedging because he thought he had gone
too far, but she appeared not to notice it. Her
eyes had the faraway look of one who communes
with herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could only see him and have a talk with
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What good would that do?&#8221; he pretended to
scoff.</p>
<p>But he watched her closely nevertheless.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I could get him to do as I ask. He
nearly always does.&#8221; Her gaze went swiftly back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
to him. &#8220;Let me talk with him. There&#8217;s a reason
why he ought to be free now, one that would appeal
to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was what he had come for, but now that
she had met him half way he hesitated. If she
should not succeed he would be worse off than before.
He could neither hold her a prisoner nor
free her to lead the pack of the law to his hiding
place. On the other hand if Cullison thought they
intended to keep her prisoner he would have to
compromise. He dared not leave her in the hands
of Lute Blackwell. Fendrick decided to take a
chance. At the worst he could turn them both free
and leave for Sonora.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. I&#8217;ll take you to him. But you&#8217;ll have
to do as I say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m taking you to back my play. I tell you
straight that Blackwell would like nothing better
than to put a bullet through your father. But I&#8217;ve
got a hold on the fellow that ties him. He&#8217;s got
to do as I say. But if I&#8217;m not there and it comes
to a showdown&mdash;if Bucky O&#8217;Connor for instance
happens to stumble in&mdash;then it&#8217;s all off with Luck
Cullison. Blackwell won&#8217;t hesitate a second. He&#8217;ll
kill your father and make a bolt for it. That&#8217;s
one reason why I&#8217;m taking you. I want to pile up
witnesses against the fellow so as to make him go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
slow. But that&#8217;s not my main object. You&#8217;ve got
to persuade Luck to come through with an agreement
to let go of that Del Oro homestead and to
promise not to prosecute us. He won&#8217;t do it to
save his own life. He&#8217;s got to think you come there
as my prisoner. See? He&#8217;s got to wrestle with
the notion that you&#8217;re in the power of the damnedest
villain that ever went unhung. I mean Blackwell.
Let him chew on that proposition a while and see
what he makes of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded, white to the lips. &#8220;Let us go at
once, please. I don&#8217;t want to leave Father alone
with that man.&#8221; She called across to the corral.
&#8220;Manuel, saddle the pinto for me. Hurry!&#8221;</p>
<p>They rode together through the wind-swept sunlit
land. From time to time his lazy glance embraced
her, a supple graceful creature at perfect
ease in the saddle. What was it about her that
drew the eye so irresistibly? Prettier girls he had
often seen. Her features were irregular, mouth and
nose too large, face a little thin. Her contour lacked
the softness, the allure that in some women was
an unconscious invitation to cuddle. Tough as
whipcord she might be, but in her there flowed a
life vital and strong; dwelt a spirit brave and unconquerable.
She seemed to him as little subtle as
any woman he had ever met. This directness came
no doubt from living so far from feminine influences.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
But he had a feeling that if a man once
wakened her to love, the instinct of sex would
spring full-grown into being.</p>
<p>They talked of the interests common to the
country, of how the spring rains had helped the
range, of Shorty McCabe&#8217;s broken leg, of the new
school district that was being formed. Before she
knew it Kate was listening to his defense of himself
in the campaign between him and her
father. He found her a partisan beyond chance
of conversion. Yet she heard patiently his justification.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t make the conditions that are here. I
have to accept them. The government establishes
forest reserves on the range. No use ramming my
head against a stone wall. Uncle Sam is bigger
than we are. Your father and his friends got stubborn.
I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you were very wise,&#8221; she admitted dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean because I adapted myself to the conditions
and made the best of them. Why shouldn&#8217;t
I?&#8221; he flushed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father&#8217;s cattle had run over that range thirty
years almost. What right had you to take it from
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Conditions change. He wouldn&#8217;t see it. I did.
As for the right of it&mdash;well, Luck ain&#8217;t king of the
valley just because he thinks he is.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></p>
<p>She began to grow angry. A dull flush burned
through the tan of her cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you bought sheep and brought them in to
ruin the range, knowing that they would cut the
feeding ground to pieces, kill the roots of vegetation
with their sharp hoofs, and finally fill the
country with little gullies to carry off the water
that ought to sink into the ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheep ain&#8217;t so bad if they are run right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It depends where they run. This is no place for
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what you hear your father say. He&#8217;s
prejudiced.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re not, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m more reasonable than he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you are,&#8221; she flung back at him irritably.</p>
<p>Open country lay before them. They had come
out from a stretch of heavy underbrush. Catclaw
had been snatching at their legs. Cholla had made
the traveling bad for the horses. Now she put her
pony to a canter that for the time ended conversation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>A COMPROMISE</h3>
</div>

<p>Luck lay stretched full length on a bunk, his face,
to the roof, a wreath of smoke from his cigar traveling
slowly toward the ceiling into a filmy blue cloud
which hung above him. He looked the personification
of vigorous full-blooded manhood at ease. Experience
had taught him to take the exigencies of
his turbulent life as they came, nonchalantly, to the
eye of an observer indifferently, getting all the comfort
the situation had to offer.</p>
<p>By the table, facing him squarely, sat José
Dominguez, a neatly built Mexican with snapping
black eyes, a manner of pleasant suavity, and an
ever-ready smile that displayed a double row of
shining white teeth. That smile did not for an
instant deceive Luck. He knew that José had no
grudge against him, that he was a very respectable
citizen, and that he would regretfully shoot him full
of holes if occasion called for so drastic a termination
to their acquaintanceship. For Dominguez had a
third interest in the C.&nbsp;F. ranch, and he was the
last man in the world to sacrifice his business for
sentiment. Having put the savings of a lifetime
into the sheep business, he did not propose to let
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
anybody deprive him of his profits either legally or
illegally.</p>
<p>Luck was talking easily, in the most casual and
amiable of voices.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Dominguez, the way I look at it you and
Cass got in bad this time. Here&#8217;s the point. In
this little vendetta of ours both sides were trying
to keep inside the law and win out. When you
elected Bolt sheriff that was one to you. When you
took out that grazing permit and cut me off the
reserve that was another time you scored heavy. A
third time was when you brought &#8217;steen thousand
of Mary&#8217;s little lambs baaing across the desert.
Well, I come back at you by deeding the Circle C
to my girl and taking up the Del Oro homestead.
You contest and lose. Good enough. It&#8217;s up to
you to try another move.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Si, Señor</i>, and we move immediate. We persuade
you to visit us at our summer mountain home
where we can talk at leisure. We suggest a compromise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luck grinned. &#8220;Your notion of a compromise
and mine don&#8217;t tally, José. Your idea is for me
to give you the apple and stand by while you eat it.
Trouble is that both parties to this quarrel are
grabbers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True, but Señor Cullison must remember his
hands are tied behind him. He will perhaps not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
find the grabbing good,&#8221; his opponent suggested
politely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to that, your hands are tied too, my friend.
You can&#8217;t hold me here forever. Put me out of
business and the kid will surely settle your hash by
proving up on the claim. What are you going to
do about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since you ask me, I can only say that it depends
on you. Sign the relinquishment, give us your word
not to prosecute, and you may leave in three hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cullison shook his head. &#8220;That&#8217;s where you get
in wrong. Buck up against the law and you are
sure to lose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we lose you lose too,&#8221; Dominguez answered
significantly.</p>
<p>The tinkle of hoofs from the river bed in the
gulch below rose through the clear air. The Mexican
moved swiftly to the door and presently waved
a handkerchief.</p>
<p>&#8220;What gent are you wig-wagging to now?&#8221; Luck
asked from the bed. &#8220;Thought I knew all you bold
bad bandits by this time. Or is it Cass back again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s Cass. There&#8217;s someone with him too.
It is a woman,&#8221; the Mexican discovered in apparent
surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;A woman!&#8221; Luck took the cigar from his
mouth in vague unease. &#8220;What is he doing here
with a woman?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></p>
<p>The Mexican smiled behind his open hand. &#8220;Your
question anticipates mine, Señor. I too ask the
same.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sight of his daughter in the doorway went
through the cattleman with a chilling shock. She
ran forward and with a pathetic cry of joy threw
herself upon him where he stood. His hands were
tied behind him. Only by the turn of his head
and by brushing his unshaven face against hers
could he answer her caresses. There was a look of
ineffable tenderness on his face, for he loved her
more than anything else on earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Fendrick brought me,&#8221; she explained when
articulate expression was possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;He brought you, did he?&#8221; Luck looked across
her shoulder at his enemy, and his eyes grew hard
as jade.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of my own free will,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;I promised you a better argument than those I&#8217;d
given you. Miss Cullison is that argument,&#8221; Fendrick
said.</p>
<p>The cattleman&#8217;s set face had a look more deadly
than words. It told Fendrick he would gladly have
killed him where he stood. For Luck knew he was
cornered and must yield. Neither Dominguez nor
Blackwell would consent to let her leave otherwise.</p>
<p>&#8220;He brought me here to have a talk with you,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
Dad. You must sign any paper he wants you to
sign.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And did he promise to take you back home after
our talk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Cullison would not want to leave as long
as her father was here,&#8221; Fendrick answered for
her glibly with a smile that said more than the
words.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to hold you responsible for bringing
her here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fendrick could not face steadily the eyes of his
foe. They bored into him like gimlets.</p>
<p>&#8220;And responsible for getting her back home
just as soon as I say the word,&#8221; Luck added,
the taut muscles standing out in his clenched
jaw.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect your say-so won&#8217;t be final in this matter,
Luck. But I&#8217;ll take the responsibility. Miss Cullison
will get home at the proper time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going home till you do,&#8221; the girl broke
in. &#8220;Oh, Dad, we&#8217;ve been so worried. You can&#8217;t
think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve played a rotten trick on me, Fendrick.
I wouldn&#8217;t have thought it even of a sheepman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No use you getting crazy with the heat, Cullison.
Your daughter asked me to bring her here,
and I brought her. Of course I&#8217;m not going to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
break my neck getting her home where she can
&#8217;phone Bolt or Bucky O&#8217;Connor and have us rounded
up. That ain&#8217;t reasonable to expect. But I aim to
do what&#8217;s right. We&#8217;ll all have supper together
like sensible folks. Then José and I will give you
the cabin for the night if you&#8217;ll promise not to
attempt to escape. In the morning maybe you&#8217;ll
see things different.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fendrick calculated not without reason that the
best thing to do would be to give Kate a chance for
a long private talk with her father. Her influence
would be more potent than any he could bring to
bear.</p>
<p>After supper the door of the cabin was locked and
a sentry posted. The prisoners were on parole, but
Cass did not on that account relax his vigilance.
For long he and his partner could hear a low murmur
of voices from within the cabin. At length
the lights went out and presently the voices died.
But all through the night one or the other of the
sheepmen patroled a beat that circled around and
around the house.</p>
<p>Fendrick did not broach the subject at issue next
morning till after breakfast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what have you decided?&#8221; he asked at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s hear about that compromise. What is it
you offer?&#8221; Luck demanded gruffly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You sign the relinquishment and agree not to
make us any trouble because we brought you here,
and you may go by two o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to reach Saguache with the relinquishment
in time to file it before I could get to
a &#8217;phone. You don&#8217;t trust me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fendrick smiled. &#8220;When we let you go we&#8217;re
trusting you a heap more than we would most men.
But of course you&#8217;re going to be sore about this
and we don&#8217;t want to put temptation in your way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. Well, I accept your terms. I&#8217;ll make
you no <i>legal</i> trouble. But I tell you straight this
thing ain&#8217;t ended. It&#8217;s only just begun. I&#8217;m going
to run you out of this country before I&#8217;m through
with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to it. We&#8217;ll see whether you make good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is that paper you want me to sign?&#8221;</p>
<p>Luck dashed off his signature and pushed the
document from him. He hated the necessity that
forced him to surrender. For himself he would
have died rather than give way, but he had to think
of his daughter and of his boy Sam who was engaged
in a plot to hold up a train.</p>
<p>His stony eyes met those of the man across the
table. &#8220;No need for me to tell you what I think
of this. A white man wouldn&#8217;t have done such a
trick. It takes sheepherders and greasers to put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
across a thing so damnable as dragging a woman
into a feud.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fendrick flushed angrily. &#8220;It&#8217;s not my fault;
you&#8217;re a pigheaded obstinate chump. I used the only
weapon left me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kate, standing straight and tall behind her
father&#8217;s chair, looked at their common foe with uncompromising
scorn. &#8220;He is not to blame, Dad.
He can&#8217;t help it because he doesn&#8217;t see how despicable
a thing he has done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the blood rushed to the face of the sheepman.
&#8220;I reckon that will hold me hitched for the
present, Miss Cullison. In the meantime I&#8217;ll go
file that homestead entry of mine. Nothing like
living up to the opinion your friends have of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He wheeled away abruptly, but as he went out
of the door one word came to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Friends!&#8221; Kate had repeated, and her voice
told fully the contempt she felt.</p>
<p>At exactly two o&#8217;clock Dominguez set the Cullisons
on the homeward road. He fairly dripped
apologies for the trouble to which he and his friends
had been compelled to put them.</p>
<p>Blackwell, who had arrived to take his turn as
guard, stood in the doorway and sulkily watched
them go.</p>

<p>From the river bed below the departing guests
looked up at the cabin hidden in the pines. The
daughter was thanking God in her heart that the
affair was ended. Her father was vowing to himself
that it had just begun.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>AN ARREST</h3>
</div>

<p>After half a week in the saddle Lieutenant Bucky
O&#8217;Connor of the Arizona Rangers and Curly Flandrau
reached Saguache tired and travel-stained.
They had combed the Rincons without having met
hide or hair of the men they wanted. Early next
morning they would leave town again and this time
would make for Soapy Stone&#8217;s horse ranch.</p>
<p>Bucky O&#8217;Connor was not disheartened. Though
he was the best man hunter in Arizona, it was all
in the day&#8217;s work that criminals should sometimes
elude him. But with Curly the issue was a personal
one. He owed Luck Cullison a good deal and
his imagination had played over the picture of that
moment when he could go to Kate and tell her he
had freed her father.</p>
<p>After reaching town the first thing each of them
did was to take a bath, the second to get shaved.
From the barber shop they went to the best restaurant
in Saguache. Curly was still busy with
his pie <i>à la mode</i> when Burridge Thomas, United
States Land Commissioner for that district, took the
seat opposite and told to O&#8217;Connor a most interesting
piece of news.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></p>
<p>They heard him to an end without interruption.
Then Curly spoke one word. &#8220;Fendrick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, Cass Fendrick. Came in about one
o&#8217;clock and handed me the relinquishment just as
I&#8217;ve been telling you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then filed on the claim himself, you said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, took it up himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure the signature to the relinquishment was
genuine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d take oath to it. As soon as he had gone I
got out the original filing and compared the two.
Couldn&#8217;t be any possible mistake. Nobody could
have forged the signature. It is like Luck himself,
strong and forceful and decided.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not entirely surprised, Mr. Thomas,&#8221;
Lieutenant O&#8217;Connor told the commissioner. &#8220;In
point of fact we&#8217;ve rather been looking for something
of the kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you know where Luck is?&#8221; Thomas, a
sociable garrulous soul, leaned forward eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we don&#8217;t. But we&#8217;ve a notion Fendrick
knows.&#8221; Bucky gave the government appointee his
most blandishing smile. &#8220;Of course we know <i>you</i>
won&#8217;t talk about this, Mr. Thomas. Can we depend
on your deputies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll speak to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re much obliged to you. This clears up a
point that was in doubt to us. By the way, what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
was the date when the relinquishment was signed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And who was the notary that witnessed it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dominguez. He&#8217;s a partner of Fendrick in the
sheep business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite a family affair, isn&#8217;t it. Well, I&#8217;ll let you
know how things come out, Mr. Thomas. You&#8217;ll
be interested to know. Have a cigar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucky rose. &#8220;See you later, Curly. Sorry I
have to hurry, Mr. Thomas, but I&#8217;ve thought of
something I&#8217;ll have to do right away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucky followed El Molino Street to the old plaza
and cut across it to the Hotel Wayland. After a
sharp scrutiny of the lobby and a nod of recognition
to an acquaintance he sauntered to the desk
and looked over the register. There, among the
arrivals of the day, was the entry he had hoped
to see.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>Cass Fendrick, C.&nbsp;F. Ranch, Arizona.</p>
</div>

<p>The room that had been assigned to him was 212.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything you want in particular, Lieutenant?&#8221;
the clerk asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No-o. Just looking to see who came in to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned away and went up the stairs, ignoring
the elevator. On the second floor he found 212.
In answer to his knock a voice said &#8220;Come in.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
Opening the door, he stepped in, closed it behind
him, and looked at the man lying in his shirt sleeves
on the bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Evening, Cass.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fendrick put down his newspaper but did not
rise. &#8220;Evening, Bucky.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their eyes held to each other with the level even
gaze of men who recognize a worthy antagonist.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to ask a question or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kick them out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;First, I would like to know what you paid Luck
Cullison for his Del Oro claim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thinking of buying me out?&#8221; was the ironical
retort of the man on the bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not quite. I&#8217;ve got another reason for wanting
to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you better ask Cullison. The law says
that if a man <i>sells</i> a relinquishment he can&#8217;t file
on another claim. If he surrenders it for nothing
he can. Now Luck may have notions of filing on
another claim. You can see that we&#8217;ll have to take
it for granted he gave me the claim.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was so neat an answer and at the same time
so complete a one that O&#8217;Connor could not help
appreciating it. He smiled and tried again.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll put that question in the discard. That
paper was signed by Luck to-day. Where was he
when you got it from him?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sure it was signed to-day? Couldn&#8217;t it have
been ante-dated?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know better than I do. When was it
signed?&#8221;</p>
<p>Fendrick laughed. He was watching the noted
officer of rangers with narrowed wary eyes. &#8220;On
advice of counsel I decline to answer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, Cass. That leaves me only one thing
to do. You&#8217;re under arrest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For what?&#8221; demanded the sheepman sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;For abducting Luck Cullison and holding him
prisoner without his consent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lazily Cass drawled a question. &#8220;Are you right
sure Cullison can&#8217;t be found?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you right sure he ain&#8217;t at home attending
to his business?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he come back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe so. I&#8217;m not Luck Cullison&#8217;s keeper.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucky thought he understood. In return for the
relinquishment Cullison had been released. Knowing
Luck as he did, it was hard for him to see how
pressure enough had been brought to bear to move
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I use your &#8217;phone?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Help yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fendrick pretended to have lost interest. He returned
to his newspaper, but his ears were alert to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
catch what went on over the wires. It was always
possible that Cullison might play him false and
break the agreement. Cass did not expect this, for
the owner of the Circle C was a man whose word
was better than most men&#8217;s bond. But the agreement
had been forced upon him through a trick.
How far he might feel this justified him in ignoring
it the sheepman did not know.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Connor got the Circle C on long distance. It
was the clear contralto of a woman that answered
his &#8220;Hello!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this Miss Cullison?&#8221; he asked. Almost at
once he added: &#8220;O&#8217;Connor of the rangers is speaking.
I&#8217;ve heard your father is home again. Is
that true?&#8221;</p>
<p>An interval followed during which the ranger
officer was put into the role of a listener. His
occasional &#8220;Yes&mdash;&mdash;Yes&mdash;&mdash;Yes&#8221; punctuated the
rapid murmur that reached Fendrick.</p>
<p>Presently Bucky asked a question. &#8220;On his way
to town now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the rapid murmur.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll attend to that, Miss Cullison. I am in Fendrick&#8217;s
room now. Make your mind easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucky hung up and turned to the sheepman. The
latter showed him a face of derision. He had
gathered one thing that disquieted him, but he did
not intend to let O&#8217;Connor know it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he jeered. &#8220;Find friend Cullison in
tolerable health?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been talking with his daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I judged as much. Miss Spitfire well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Cullison didn&#8217;t mention her health. We
were concerned about yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cullison is headed for town and his daughter is
afraid he is on the warpath against you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She wanted me to get you out of her father&#8217;s
way until he has cooled down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very kind of her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s right, too. You and Luck mustn&#8217;t meet
yet. Get out of here and hunt cover in the hills for
a few days. You know why better than I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I when I&#8217;m under arrest?&#8221; Fendrick
mocked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not under arrest. Miss Cullison says
her father has no charge to bring against you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you can light a shuck soon as you want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which won&#8217;t be in any hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make any mistake. Luck Cullison is a
dangerous man when he is roused.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheepman looked at the ranger with opaque
stony eyes. &#8220;If Luck Cullison is looking for me he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
is liable to find me, and he won&#8217;t have to go into
the hills to hunt me either.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucky understood perfectly. According to the
code of the frontier no man could let himself be
driven from town by the knowledge that another
man was looking for him with a gun. There are in
the Southwest now many thousands who do not live
by the old standard, who are anchored to law and
civilization as a protection against primitive passions.
But Fendrick was not one of these. He had
deliberately gone outside of the law in his feud
with the cattleman. Now he would not repudiate
the course he had chosen and hedge because of the
danger it involved. He was an aspirant to leadership
among the tough hard-bitted denizens of the
sunbaked desert. That being so, he had to see his
feud out to a fighting finish if need be.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are points about this case you have overlooked,&#8221;
Bucky told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe so. But the important one that sticks
out like a sore thumb is that no man living can
serve notice on me to get out of town because he is
coming on the shoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Luck didn&#8217;t serve any such notice. All his
daughter knows is that he is hot under the collar.
Look at things reasonably, Cass. You&#8217;ve caused
that young lady a heap of trouble already. Are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
you going to unload a lot more on her just because
you want to be pigheaded. Only a kid struts around
and hollers &#8216;Who&#8217;s afraid?&#8217; No, it&#8217;s up to you
to pull out, not because of Luck Cullison but on
account of his daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is such a thorough friend of mine,&#8221; the
sheepman added with his sardonic grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you care about that? She&#8217;s a girl. I
don&#8217;t know the facts, but I can guess them. She and
Luck will stand pat on what they promised you.
Don&#8217;t you owe her something for that? Seems to me
a white man wouldn&#8217;t make her any more worry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s because I am a white man that I can&#8217;t dodge
a fight when it&#8217;s stacked up for me, Bucky.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said it with a dogged finality that was unshaken,
but O&#8217;Connor made one more effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody will know why you left.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would know, wouldn&#8217;t I? I&#8217;ve got to go right
on living with myself. I tell you straight I&#8217;m
going to see it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucky&#8217;s jaw clamped. &#8220;Not if I know it. You&#8217;re
under arrest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fendrick sat up in surprise. &#8220;What for?&#8221; he
demanded angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;For robbing the W.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;S. Express Company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell, Bucky. You don&#8217;t believe that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind what I believe. There&#8217;s some evidence
against you&mdash;enough to justify me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You want to get me out of Cullison&#8217;s way.
That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you like to put it so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t stand for it. That ain&#8217;t square.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll stand for it, my friend. I gave you a
chance to clear out and you wouldn&#8217;t take it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t because I couldn&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t make any
mistake about this. I&#8217;m not looking for Luck. I&#8217;m
attending to my business. Arrest <i>him</i> if you want
to stop trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>There came a knock on the door. It opened to
admit Luck Cullison. He shut it and put his back
to it, while his eyes, hard as hammered iron, swept
past the officer to fix on Fendrick.</p>
<p>The latter rose quickly from the bed, but O&#8217;Connor
flung him back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget you&#8217;re my prisoner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s your prisoner, is he?&#8221; This was a turn of
affairs for which Luck was manifestly unprepared:
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve come to have a little settlement with
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fendrick, tense as a coiled spring, watched him
warily. &#8220;Can&#8217;t be any too soon to suit me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clear cut as a pair of scissors through paper,
Bucky snapped out his warning. &#8220;Nothing stirring,
gentlemen. I&#8217;ll shoot the first man that makes a
move.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you in this, Bucky?&#8221; asked Cullison evenly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right I am. He&#8217;s my prisoner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For robbing the W.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;S.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luck&#8217;s face lit. &#8220;Have you evidence enough to
cinch him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not enough yet. But I&#8217;ll take no chances on
his getting away.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cattleman&#8217;s countenance reflected his thoughts
as his decision hung in the balance. He longed to
pay his debt on the spot. But on the other hand
he had been a sheriff himself. As an outsider he
had no right to interfere between an officer and his
captive. Besides, if there was a chance to send
Fendrick over the road that would be better than
killing. It would clear up his own reputation, to
some extent under a cloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Bucky. If the law wants him I&#8217;ll step
aside for the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheepman laughed in his ironic fashion. His
amusement mocked them both. &#8220;Most as good as a
play of the movies, ain&#8217;t it? But we&#8217;d ought all
to have our guns out to make it realistic.&#8221;</p>
<p>But in his heart he did not jeer. For the situation
had been nearer red tragedy than melodrama.
The resource and firmness of Bucky O&#8217;Connor had
alone made it possible to shave disaster by a hair&#8217;s
breadth and no more.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>A CONVERSATION</h3>
</div>

<p>Bucky O&#8217;Connor and his prisoner swung down
the street side by side and turned in at the headquarters
of the rangers. The officer switched on
the light, shut the door, and indicated a chair. From
his desk he drew a box of cigars. He struck a
match and held it for the sheepman before using it
himself.</p>
<p>Relaxed in his chair, Fendrick spoke with rather
elaborate indolence.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your evidence, Bucky? You can&#8217;t hold
me without any. What have you got that ties me
to the W.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;S. robbery?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that hat play, Cass? You let on you had
shot Cullison&#8217;s hat off his head while he was making
his getaway. Come to find out you had his hat in
your possession all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does that prove I did it myself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks funny you happened to be right there
while the robbery was taking place and that you
had Luck&#8217;s hat with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sleepy tiger look lay warily in the sheepman&#8217;s
eyes. &#8220;That&#8217;s what the dictionaries call a coincidence,
Bucky.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They may. I&#8217;m not sure I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fact, just the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a notion it will take some explaining.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Confidentially?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Confidentially what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The explanation. You won&#8217;t use it against me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if you weren&#8217;t in the hold-up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t. This is the way it happened. You
know Cullison was going to prove up on that Del
Oro claim on Thursday. That would have put the
C.&nbsp;F. ranch out of business. I knew he was in town
and at the Del Mar, but I didn&#8217;t know where he
would be next day. He had me beat. I couldn&#8217;t
see any way out but to eat crow and offer a compromise.
I hated it like hell, but it was up to me
to hunt Luck up and see what he would do. His
hat gave me an excuse to call. So I started out
and came round the corner of San Mateo Street
just in time to see the robber pull out. Honest,
the fellow did shape up a little like Luck. Right
then I got the darned fool notion of mixing him
up in it. I threw his hat down and shot a hole in
it, then unlocked the door of the express office
carrying the hat in my hand. That&#8217;s all there was
to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty low-down trick, wasn&#8217;t it, to play on an
innocent man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was figuring to do me up. I don&#8217;t say it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
was exactly on the square, but I was sore at him
clear through. I wanted to get him into trouble.
I <i>had</i> to do something to keep his mind busy till I
could turn round and think of a way out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucky reflected, looking at the long ash on his
cigar. &#8220;The man that made the raid of the W.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;S.
shaped up like Luck, you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a general way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ranger brushed the ash from the end of the
cigar into the tray. Then he looked quietly at Fendrick.
&#8220;Who was the man, Cass?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I told you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did. But you lied. It was a moonlight
night. And there&#8217;s an arc light at that corner. By
your own story, the fellow took his mask off as he
swung to his horse. You saw his face just as distinctly
as I see yours now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I reckon not,&#8221; Fendrick grinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning you won&#8217;t tell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not how I put it, Bucky. You&#8217;re the one
that says I recognized him. Come to think of it,
I&#8217;m not sure the fellow didn&#8217;t wear his mask till he
was out of sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. The mask was found just outside the
office where the man dropped it before he got into
the saddle.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not all. Curly and I found something
else, too&mdash;the old shirt from which the cloth was
cut.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheepman swept him with one of his side-long,
tiger-cat glances. &#8220;Where did you find it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a barrel back of the Jack of Hearts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, if you only knew who put it there,&#8221; suggested
Cass, with ironic hopefulness.</p>
<p>&#8220;It happens I do. I have a witness who saw a
man shove that old shirt down in the barrel after
tearing a piece off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your witness got a name, Bucky?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not mention the name now. If it became
too well known something might happen to my witness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fendrick nodded. &#8220;You&#8217;re wiser there. She
wouldn&#8217;t be safe, not if a certain man happened to
hear what you&#8217;ve just told me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say <i>she</i>, Cass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I said it. Your witness is Mrs. Wylie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe, then, you can guess the criminal, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I could, but I&#8217;m not going to try.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll drop that subject. I&#8217;ll ask you a
question. Can you tell me where I can find a paroled
convict named Blackwell?&#8221;</p>
<p>Fendrick shook his head. &#8220;Don&#8217;t know the gentleman.
A friend of yours?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>&#8220;One of yours. Better come through, Cass. I&#8217;m
satisfied you weren&#8217;t actually in this robbery, but
there is such a thing as accessory after the fact.
Now, I&#8217;m going to get that man. If you want to
put yourself right, it&#8217;s up to you to give me the
information I want. Where is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t got him in <i>my</i> pocket.&#8221;</p>
<p>The officer rose, not one whit less amiable. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t expect you to tell me. That&#8217;s all right. I&#8217;ll
find him. But in the meantime I&#8217;ll have to lock you
up till this thing is settled.&#8221;</p>
<p>From his inside coat pocket, Fendrick drew a
sealed envelope, wrote the date across the front,
and handed it to O&#8217;Connor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep this, Bucky, and remember that I gave it
to you. Put it in a safe place, but don&#8217;t open the
envelope till I give the word. Understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear what you say, but I don&#8217;t understand
what you mean&mdash;what&#8217;s back of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t intended that you should yet. I&#8217;m protecting
myself. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guessed that much. Well, if you&#8217;re ready, I&#8217;ll
arrange your lodgings for the night, Cass. I
reckon I&#8217;ll put you up at a hotel with one of the
boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as you say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fendrick rose, and the two men passed into the
street.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>A TOUCH OF THE THIRD DEGREE</h3>
</div>

<p>Cullison was not the man to acknowledge himself
beaten so long as there was a stone unturned. In
the matter of the Del Oro homestead claim he
moved at once. All of the county commissioners
were personal friends of his, and he went to them
with a plan for a new road to run across the Del
Oro at the point where the cañon walls opened to a
valley.</p>
<p>&#8220;What in Mexico is the good of a county road
there, Luck? Can&#8217;t run a wagon over them mountains
and down to the river. Looks to me like it
would be a road from nowhere to nowhere,&#8221; Alec
Flandrau protested, puzzled at his friend&#8217;s request.</p>
<p>&#8220;I done guessed it,&#8221; Yesler announced with a
grin. &#8220;Run a county road through, and Cass Fendrick
can&#8217;t fence the river off from Luck&#8217;s cows.
Luck ain&#8217;t aiming to run any wagon over that
road.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Map of Texas man got up and stamped with
delight. &#8220;I get you. We&#8217;ll learn Cass to take a
joke, by gum. Luck sure gets a county road for
his cows to amble over down to the water. Cass
can have his darned old homestead now.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></p>
<p>When Fendrick heard that the commissioners
had condemned a right of way for a road through
his homestead he unloaded on the desert air a rich
vocabulary. For here would have been a simple
way out of his trouble if he had only thought of it.
Instead of which he had melodramatically kidnapped
his enemy and put himself within reach of
the law and of Cullison&#8217;s vengeance.</p>
<p>Nor did Luck confine his efforts to self-defense.
He knew that to convict Fendrick of the robbery
he must first lay hands upon Blackwell.</p>
<p>It was, however, Bucky that caught the convict.
The two men met at the top of a mountain pass.
Blackwell, headed south, was slipping down toward
Stone&#8217;s horse ranch when they came face to face.
Before the bad man had his revolver out, he found
himself looking down the barrel of the ranger&#8217;s
leveled rifle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; Bucky murmured genially.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you want me for?&#8221; Blackwell demanded
sulkily.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the W.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;S. robbery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not the man you want. My name&#8217;s Johnson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll put up with you till I find the man I do
want, Mr. Johnson,&#8221; Bucky told him cheerfully.
&#8220;Climb down from that horse. No, I wouldn&#8217;t try
that. Keep your hands up.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></p>
<p>With his prisoner in front of him, O&#8217;Connor
turned townward. They jogged down out of the
hills through dark gulches and cactus-clad arroyos.
The sharp catclaw caught at their legs. Tangled
mesquite and ironwood made progress slow. They
reached in time Apache Desert, and here Bucky
camped. He hobbled his prisoner&#8217;s feet and put
around his neck a rope, the other end of which was
tied to his own waist. Then he built a small fire
of greasewood and made coffee for them both. The
prisoner slept, but his captor did not. For he could
take no chances of an escape.</p>
<p>The outlines of the mountain ranges loomed
shadowy and dim on both sides. The moonlight
played strange tricks with the mesquit and the giant
cactus, a grove of which gave to the place an awesome
aspect of some ghostly burial ground of a
long vanished tribe.</p>
<p>Next day they reached Saguache. Bucky took
his prisoner straight to the ranger&#8217;s office and telephoned
to Cullison.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I get anything to eat?&#8221; growled the convict
while they waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I&#8217;m ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucky believed in fair play. The man had not
eaten since last night. But then neither had he. It
happened that Bucky was tough as whipcord, as
supple and untiring as a hickory sapling. Well,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
Blackwell was a pretty hard nut to crack, too. The
lieutenant did not know anything about book
psychology, but he had observed that hunger and
weariness try out the stuff that is in a man. Under
the sag of them many a will snaps that would have
held fast if sustained by a good dinner and a sound
night&#8217;s sleep. This is why so many &#8220;bad men,&#8221;
gun fighters with a reputation for gameness, wilt
on occasion like whipped curs. In the old days
this came to nearly every terror of the border.
Some day when he had a jumping toothache, or
when his nerves were frayed from a debauch, a
silent stranger walked into his presence, looked
long and steadily into his eyes, and ended forever
his reign of lawlessness. Sometimes the two-gun
man was &#8220;planted,&#8221; sometimes he subsided into
innocuous peace henceforth.</p>
<p>The ranger had a shrewd instinct that the hour
had come to batter down this fellow&#8217;s dogged resistance.
Therefore he sent for Cullison, the man
whom the convict most feared.</p>
<p>The very look of the cattleman, with that grim,
hard, capable aspect, shook Blackwell&#8217;s nerve.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;ve got him, Bucky.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luck looked the man over as he sat handcuffed
beside the table and read in his face both terror
and a sly, dogged cunning. Once before the fellow
had been put through the third degree. Something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
of the sort he fearfully expected now. Villainy
is usually not consistent. This hulking bully
should have been a hardy ruffian. Instead, he
shrank like a schoolgirl from the thought of physical
pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand up,&#8221; ordered Cullison quietly.</p>
<p>Blackwell got to his feet at once. He could not
help it, even though the fear in his eyes showed
that he cowered before the anticipated attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t hit me,&#8221; he whined.</p>
<p>Luck knew the man sweated under the punishment
his imagination called up, and he understood
human nature too well to end the suspense by making
real the vision. For then the worst would be
past, since the actual is never equal to what is expected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; Luck watched him with the look of
tempered steel in his hard eyes.</p>
<p>The convict flinched, moistened his lips with his
tongue, and spoke at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;Mr. Cullison, I want to explain. Every
man is liable to make a mistake&mdash;go off half cocked.
I didn&#8217;t do right. That&#8217;s a fac&#8217;. I can explain all
that, but I&#8217;m sick now&mdash;awful sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cullison laughed harshly. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be sicker
soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You promised you wouldn&#8217;t do anything if we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
turned you loose,&#8221; the man plucked up courage to
remind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I promised the law wouldn&#8217;t do anything.
You&#8217;ll understand the distinction presently.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Cullison, please&mdash;&mdash; I admit I done
wrong. I hadn&#8217;t ought to have gone in with Cass
Fendrick. He wanted me to kill you, but I
wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that unwinking gaze the ranchman beat
down his lies, while fear dripped in perspiration
from the pallid face of the prisoner.</p>
<p>Bucky had let Cullison take the center of the
stage. He had observed a growing distress mount
and ride the victim. Now he stepped in to save
the man with an alternative at which Blackwell
might be expected not to snatch eagerly perhaps,
but at least to be driven toward.</p>
<p>&#8220;This man is my prisoner, Mr. Cullison. From
what I can make out you ought to strip his hide
off and hang it up to dry. But I&#8217;ve got first call on
him. If he comes through with the truth about the
W.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;S. Express robbery, I&#8217;ve got to protect him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luck understood the ranger. They were both
working toward the same end. The immediate
punishment of this criminal was not the important
issue. It was merely a club with which to beat him
into submission, and at that a moral rather than a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
physical one. But the owner of the Circle C knew
better than to yield to Bucky too easily. He
fought the point out with him at length, and finally
yielded reluctantly, in such a way as to aggravate
rather than relieve the anxiety of the convict.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. You take him first,&#8221; he finally conceded
harshly.</p>
<p>Bucky kept up the comedy. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take him, Mr.
Cullison. But if he tells me the truth&mdash;and if I
find out it&#8217;s the whole truth&mdash;there&#8217;ll be nothing
doing on your part. He&#8217;s my prisoner. Understand
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Metaphorically, Blackwell licked the hand of his
protector. He was still standing, but his attitude
gave the effect of crouching.</p>
<p>&#8220;I aim to do what&#8217;s right, Captain O&#8217;Connor.
Whatever&#8217;s right. You ask me any questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to know all about the W.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;S. robbery,
everything, from start to finish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Honest, I wish I could tell you. But I don&#8217;t
know a thing about it. Cross my heart, I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No use, Blackwell. If I&#8217;m going to stand by
you against Mr. Cullison, you&#8217;ll have to tell the
truth. Why, man, I&#8217;ve even got the mask you
wore and the cloth you cut it from.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon it must a-been some one else, Major.
Wisht I could help you, but I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucky rose. &#8220;All right. If you can&#8217;t help me, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
can&#8217;t help you.&#8221; Apparently he dismissed the matter
from his mind, for he looked at his watch and
turned to the cattleman. &#8220;Mr. Cullison, I reckon
I&#8217;ll run out and have some supper. Do you mind
staying here with this man till I get back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. That&#8217;s all right, Bucky. Don&#8217;t hurry,
I&#8217;ll keep him entertained.&#8221; Perhaps it was not by
chance that his eye wandered to a blacksnake whip
hanging on the wall.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Connor sauntered to the door. The frightened
gaze of the prisoner clung to him as if for
safety.</p>
<p>&#8220;Major&mdash;Colonel&mdash;you ain&#8217;t a-going,&#8221; he
pleaded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only for an hour or two. I&#8217;ll be back. I
wouldn&#8217;t think of saying good-by&mdash;not till we
reach Yuma.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that the door closed behind him. Blackwell
cried out, hurriedly, eagerly. &#8220;Mister O&#8217;Connor!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucky&#8217;s head reappeared. &#8220;What! Have you
reduced me to the ranks already? I was looking
to be a general by the time I got back,&#8221; he complained
whimsically.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;ll tell you everything&mdash;every last thing.
Mr. Cullison&mdash;he&#8217;s aiming to kill me soon as you&#8217;ve
gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got no time to fool away, Blackwell. I&#8217;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
hungry. If you mean business get to it. But remember
that whatever you say will be used against
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you any dog-goned thing you want to
know. You&#8217;ve got me beat. I&#8217;m plumb wore out&mdash;sick.
A man can&#8217;t stand everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>O&#8217;Connor came in and closed the door. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
have it, then&mdash;the whole story. I want it all: how
you came to know about this shipment of money,
how you pulled it off, what you have done with it,
all the facts from beginning to the end.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lemme sit down, Captain. I&#8217;m awful done up.
I reckon while I was in the hills I&#8217;ve been underfed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down. There&#8217;s a good dinner waiting for
you at Clune&#8217;s when you get through.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even then, though he must have known that
lies could not avail, the man sprinkled his story
with them. The residuum of truth that remained
after these had been sifted out was something like
this.</p>
<p>He had found on the street a letter that had inadvertently
been dropped. It was to Jordan of
the Cattlemen&#8217;s National Bank, and it notified him
that $20,000 was to be shipped to him by the W.
&amp; S. Express Company on the night of the robbery.
Blackwell resolved to have a try for it. He
hung around the office until the manager and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
guard arrived from the train, made his raid upon
them, locked the door, and threw away his mask.
He dived with the satchel into the nearest alley,
and came face to face with the stranger whom he
later learned to be Fendrick. The whole story
of the horse had been a myth later invented by the
sheepman to scatter the pursuit by making it appear
that the robber had come from a distance. As
the street had been quite deserted at the time this
detail could be plausibly introduced with no chance
of a denial.</p>
<p>Fendrick, who had heard the shouting of the
men locked in the express office, stopped the robber,
but Blackwell broke away and ran down the
alley. The sheepman followed and caught him.
After another scuffle the convict again hammered
himself free, but left behind the hand satchel containing
the spoils. Fendrick (so he later explained
to Blackwell) tied a cord to the handle of
the bag and dropped it down the chute of a laundry
in such a way that it could later be drawn up. Then
he hurried back to the express office and released
the prisoners. After the excitement had subsided,
he had returned for the money and hid it. The
original robber did not know where.</p>
<p>Blackwell&#8217;s second meeting with the sheepman
had been almost as startling as the first. Cass had
run into the Jack of Hearts in time to save the life
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
of his enemy. The two men recognized each other
and entered into a compact to abduct Cullison, for
his share in which the older man was paid one thousand
dollars. The Mexican Dominguez had later
appeared on the scene, had helped guard the owner
of the Circle C, and had assisted in taking him to
the hut in the Rincons where he had been secreted.</p>
<p>Both men asked the same question as soon as he
had finished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the money you got from the raid on
the W.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;S. office?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ve been at Fendrick ever since
to tell me. He&#8217;s got it salted somewhere. You&#8217;re
fixing to put me behind the bars, and he&#8217;s the man
that really stole it.&#8221;</p>
<p>From this they could not shake him. He stuck
to it vindictively, for plainly his malice against the
sheepman was great. The latter had spoiled his
coup, robbed him of its fruits, and now was letting
him go to prison.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon we&#8217;d better have a talk with Cass,&#8221;
Bucky suggested in a low voice to the former
sheriff.</p>
<p>Luck laughed significantly. &#8220;When we find
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the sheepman had got out on bail the morning
after his arrest.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll find him easily enough. And I rather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
think he&#8217;ll have a good explanation, even if this
fellow&#8217;s story is true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;ll be loaded with explanations. I don&#8217;t
doubt that for a minute. But it will take a hell of
a lot of talk to get away from the facts. I&#8217;ve got
him where I want him now, and by God! I&#8217;ll make
him squeal before the finish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, you&#8217;re prejudiced,&#8221; Bucky told him
with an amiable smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Course I am; prejudiced as old Wall-eyed
Rogers was against the vigilantes for hanging him
on account of horse stealing. But I&#8217;ll back my
prejudices all the same. We&#8217;ll see I&#8217;m right,
Bucky.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>BOB TAKES A HAND</h3>
</div>

<p>Fendrick, riding on Mesa Verde, met Bob Cullison,
and before he knew what had happened found
a gun thrown on him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you move,&#8221; the boy warned.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does this tommyrot mean?&#8221; the sheepman
demanded angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;It means that you are coming back with me to
the ranch. That&#8217;s what it means.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never you mind what for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, go to Mexico,&#8221; Cass flung back impatiently.
&#8220;Think we&#8217;re in some fool moving-picture play,
you blamed young idiot. Put up that gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shrilly Bob retorted. He was excited enough
to be dangerous. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you get the wrong idea.
I&#8217;m going to make this stick. You&#8217;ll turn and go
back with me to the Circle C.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ll travel to Yuma first thing you
know, you young Jesse James. What <i>you</i> need is a
pair of leather chaps applied to your hide.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll go home with me, just the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got one more guess coming, kid. I&#8217;ll
not go without knowing why.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wanted for the W.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;S. Express robbery.
Blackwell has confessed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Confessed that I did it?&#8221; Fendrick inquired
scornfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Says you were in it with him. I ain&#8217;t a-going
to discuss it with you. Swing that horse round;
and don&#8217;t make any breaks, or there&#8217;ll be mourning
at the C.&nbsp;F. ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cass sat immovable as the sphinx. He was thinking
that he might as well face the charge now as
any time. Moreover, he had reasons for wanting to
visit the Circle C. They had to do with a tall, slim
girl who never looked at him without scorn in her
dark, flashing eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. I&#8217;ll go back with you, but not under
a gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll go the way I say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think it. I&#8217;ve said I&#8217;ll go. That settles
it. But I won&#8217;t stand for any gun-play capture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to stand for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fendrick&#8217;s face set. &#8220;Will I? It&#8217;s up to you,
then. Let&#8217;s see you make me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sitting there with his gaze steadily on the boy,
Cass had Bob at a disadvantage. If the sheep
owner had tried to break away into the chaparral.
Bob could have blazed away at him, but he could
not shoot a man looking at him with cynical,
amused eyes. He could understand the point of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
view of his adversary. If Fendrick rode into the
Circle C under compulsion of a gun in the hands of
a boy he would never hear the end of the laugh on
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t try to light out, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got no notion of lighting out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob put up his big blue gun reluctantly. Never
before had it been trained on a human being, and
it was a wrench to give up the thought of bringing
in the enemy as a prisoner. But he saw he could
not pull it off. Fendrick had declined to scare, had
practically laughed him out of it. The boy had not
meant his command as a bluff, but Cass knew him
better than he did himself.</p>
<p>They turned toward the Circle C.</p>
<p>&#8220;Must have been taking lessons on how to bend a
gun. You in training for sheriff, or are you going
to take Bucky&#8217;s place with the rangers?&#8221; Fendrick
asked with casual impudence, malicious amusement
gleaming from his lazy eyes.</p>
<p>Bob, very red about the ears, took refuge in a
sulky silence. He was being guyed, and not by
an inch did he propose to compromise the Cullison
dignity.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the way you go at it, I figure you an old
hand at the hold-up game. Wonder if you didn&#8217;t
pull off the W.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;S. raid yourself.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></p>
<p>Bob writhed impotently. At this sort of thing
he was no match for the other. Fendrick, now in
the best of humors, planted lazily his offhand barbs.</p>
<p>Kate was seated on the porch sewing. She rose
in surprise when her cousin and the sheepman appeared.
They came with jingling spurs across the
plaza toward her. Bob was red as a turkeycock,
but Fendrick wore his most devil-may-care insouciance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Uncle Luck, sis? I&#8217;ve brought this fellow
back with me. Caught him on the mesa,&#8221; explained
the boy sulkily.</p>
<p>Fendrick bowed rather extravagantly and flashed
at the girl a smiling double-row of strong white
teeth. &#8220;He&#8217;s qualifying for a moving-picture show
actor, Miss Cullison. I hadn&#8217;t the heart to disappoint
him when he got that cannon trained on me.
So here I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kate looked at him and then let her gaze travel
to her cousin. She somehow gave the effect of
judging him of negligible value.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s in his office, Bob. I&#8217;ll go see.&#8221;</p>
<p>She went swiftly, and presently her father came
out. Kate did not return.</p>
<p>Luck looked straight at Cass with the uncompromising
hostility so characteristic of him. Neither
of the men spoke. It was Bob who made the necessary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
explanations. The sheepman heard them
with a polite derision that suggested an impersonal
amusement at the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been looking for you,&#8221; Luck said bluntly,
after his nephew had finished.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I gathered from young Jesse James. He intimated
it over the long blue barrel of his cannon.
Anything particular, or just a pleasant social call?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in bad on this W.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;S. robbery. I reckoned
you would be safer in jail till it&#8217;s cleared up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You still sheriff, Mr. Cullison? Somehow I
had got a notion you had quit the job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m an interested party. There&#8217;s new evidence,
not manufactured, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll take the stage into town and see what
O&#8217;Connor says&mdash;that is, if you&#8217;ve got time to go.&#8221;
Luck could be as formal in his sarcasm as his neighbor.</p>
<p>&#8220;With such good company on the way I&#8217;ll have
to make time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stage did not usually leave till about half
past one. Presently Kate announced dinner. A
little awkwardly Luck invited the sheepman to join
them. Fendrick declined. He was a Fletcherite,
he informed Cullison ironically, and was in the
habit of missing meals occasionally. This would
be one of the times.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></p>
<p>His host hung in the doorway. Seldom at a loss
to express himself, he did not quite know how to
put into words what he was thinking. His enemy
understood.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right. You&#8217;ve satisfied the demands
of hospitality. Go eat your dinner. I&#8217;ll be right
here on the porch when you get through.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kate, who was standing beside her father, spoke
quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a place for you, Mr. Fendrick. We
should be very pleased to have you join us. People
who happen to be at the Circle C at dinner time
are expected to eat here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come and eat, man. You&#8217;ll be under no obligations.
I reckon you can hate us, just as thorough
after a square meal as before. Besides, I was
your guest for several days.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fendrick looked at the young mistress of the
ranch. He meant to decline once more, but unaccountably
found himself accepting instead. Something
in her face told him she would rather have
it so.</p>
<p>Wherefore Cass found himself with his feet under
the table of his foe discussing various topics
that had nothing to do with sheep, homestead
claims, abductions, or express robberies. He looked
at Kate but rarely, yet he was aware of her all
the time. At his ranch a Mexican did the cooking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
in haphazard fashion. The food was ill prepared
and worse served. He ate only because it was a
necessity, and he made as short a business of it
as he could. Here were cut roses on a snowy tablecloth,
an air of leisure that implied the object of
dinner to be something more than to devour a given
quantity of food. Moreover, the food had a flavor
that made it palatable. The rib roast was done to
a turn, the mashed potatoes whipped to a flaky
lightness. The vegetable salad was a triumph, and
the rice custard melted in his mouth.</p>
<p>Presently a young man came into the dining
room and sat down beside Kate. He looked the
least in the world surprised at sight of the sheepman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mornin&#8217;, Cass,&#8221; he nodded</p>
<p>&#8220;Morning, Curly,&#8221; answered Fendrick. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t
know you were riding for the Circle C.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s my foreman,&#8221; Luck explained.</p>
<p>Cass observed that he was quite one of the family.
Bob admired him openly and without shame,
because he was the best rider in Arizona; Kate
seemed to be on the best of terms with him, and
Luck treated him with the offhand bluffness he
might have used toward a grown son.</p>
<p>If Cass had, in his bitter, sardonic fashion, been
interested in Kate before he sat down, the feeling
had quickened to something different before he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
rose. It was not only that she was competent to
devise such a meal in the desert. There was something
else. She had made a <i>home</i> for her father
and cousin at the Circle C. The place radiated
love, domesticity, kindly good fellowship. The
casual give and take of the friendly talk went
straight to the heart of the sheepman. This was
living. It came to him poignantly that in his scramble
for wealth he had missed that which was of
far greater importance.</p>
<p>The stage brought the two men to town shortly
after sundown. Luck called up O&#8217;Connor, and
made an appointment to meet him after supper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back again, Bucky,&#8221; Fendrick grinned at sight
of the ranger. &#8220;I hear I&#8217;m suspected of being a bad
hold-up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a matter that needs explaining, Cass.
According to Blackwell&#8217;s story, you caught him
with the goods at the time of the robbery, and in
making his getaway he left the loot with you.
What have you done with it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blackwell told you that, did he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t doubt your word for a moment, Bucky,
but before I do any talking I&#8217;d like to hear him
say so. I&#8217;ll not round on him until I know he&#8217;s
given himself away.&#8221;</p>
<p>The convict was sent for. He substantiated the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
ranger reluctantly. He was so hemmed in that he
did not know how to play his cards so as to make
the most of them. He hated Fendrick. But much
as he desired to convict him, he could not escape
an uneasy feeling that he was going to be made the
victim. For Cass took it with that sarcastic smile
of his that mocked them all in turn. The convict
trusted none of them. Already he felt the penitentiary
walls closing on him. He was like a trapped
coyote, ready to snarl and bite at the first hand he
could reach. Just now this happened to belong to
Fendrick, who had cheated him out of the money he
had stolen and had brought this upon him.</p>
<p>Cass heard him out with a lifted upper lip and
his most somnolent tiger-cat expression. After
Blackwell had finished and been withdrawn from
circulation he rolled and lit a cigarette.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Mr. Blackwell&#8217;s say-so I&#8217;m the goat. By the
way, has it ever occurred to you gentlemen that
one can&#8217;t be convicted on the testimony of a single
accomplice?&#8221; He asked it casually, his chair tipped
back, smoke wreaths drifting lazily ceilingward.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a little circumstantial evidence to
add, Cass.&#8221; Bucky suggested pleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not enough&mdash;not nearly enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will be for a jury to decide,&#8221; Cullison
chipped in.</p>
<p>Fendrick shrugged. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a notion to let it go to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
that. But what&#8217;s the use? Understand this. I
wasn&#8217;t going to give Blackwell away, but since he
has talked, I may tell what I know. It&#8217;s true
enough what he says. I did relieve him of the
plunder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry to hear that, Cass,&#8221; Bucky commented
gravely. &#8220;What did you do with it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheep owner flicked his cigarette ash into the
tray, and looked at the lieutenant out of half-shuttered,
indolent eyes. &#8220;Gave it to you, Bucky.&#8221;</p>
<p>O&#8217;Connor sat up. His blue Irish eyes were dancing.
&#8220;You&#8217;re a cool customer, Cass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fact, just the same. Got that letter I handed
you the other day?&#8221;</p>
<p>The officer produced it from his safe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Open it.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a paper knife Bucky ripped the flap and
took out a sheet of paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something else in there,&#8221; Fendrick suggested.</p>
<p>The something else proved to be a piece of paper
folded tightly, which being opened disclosed a key.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Connor read aloud the letter:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>To Nicholas Bolt, Sheriff, Or Bucky
O&#8217;connor, Lieutenant of Rangers</span>:</p>
<p>Having come into possession of a little
valise which is not mine, I am getting rid
of it in the following manner. I have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
rented a large safety-deposit box at the
Cattlemen&#8217;s National Bank, and have put
into it the valise with the lock still unbroken.
The key is inclosed herewith.
Shaw, the cashier, will tell you that when
this box was rented I gave explicit orders
it should be opened only by the men
whose names are given in an envelope left
with him, not even excepting myself.
The valise was deposited at exactly 10:30
A. M. the morning after the robbery, as
Mr. Shaw will also testify. I am writing
this the evening of the same day.</p>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Cass Fendrick</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t believe a word of it,&#8221; Cullison exploded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seeing is believing,&#8221; the sheepman murmured.
He was enjoying greatly the discomfiture of his
foe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Makes a likely fairy tale. What for would you
keep the money and not turn it back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s an easy one, Luck. He wanted to throw
the burden of the robbery on you,&#8221; Bucky explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got to be shown.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the morning he was shown. Shaw confirmed
exactly what Fendrick had said. He produced a
sealed envelope. Within this was a sheet of paper,
upon which were written two lines.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>Box 2143 is to be opened only by Sheriff
Bolt or Lieutenant Bucky O&#8217;Connor of
the Rangers, and before witnesses.</p>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Cass Fendrick</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>From the safety-deposit vault Bucky drew a
large package wrapped in yellow paper. He cut the
string, tore away the covering, and disclosed a
leather satchel. Perry Hawley, the local manager
of the Western &amp; Southern Express Company, fitted
to this a key and took out a sealed bundle. This
he ripped open before them all. Inside was found
the sum of twenty thousand dollars in crisp new
bills.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>A CLEAN UP</h3>
</div>

<p>A slight accident occurred at the jail, one so
unimportant that Scanlan the jailer did not think
it worth reporting to his chief. Blackwell, while
eating, knocked a glass from the table and broke
it on the cement floor of his cell. There is a legend
to the effect that for want of a nail a battle was
lost. By reason of a bit of glass secreted in his
bed something quite as important happened to the
convict.</p>
<p>From the little table in his room he pried loose
one of the corner braces. At night he scraped away
at this with his bit of glass until the wood began to
take the shape of a revolver. This he carefully
blacked with the ink brought him by his guard. To
the end of his weapon he fitted an iron washer taken
from the bedstead. Then he waited for his opportunity.</p>
<p>His chance came through the good nature of
Scanlan. The jailer was in the habit of going
down town to loaf for an hour or two with old
cronies after he had locked up for the night. Blackwell
pretended to be out of chewing tobacco and
asked the guard to buy him some. About ten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
o&#8217;clock Scanlan returned and brought the tobacco
to his prisoner. The moon was shining brightly,
and he did not bring a lantern with him. As he
passed the plug through the grating Blackwell&#8217;s
fingers closed around his wrist and drew the man
close to the iron lattice work. Simultaneously a
cold rim was pressed against the temple of the
guard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t move, or I&#8217;ll fill you full of holes,&#8221; the
convict warned.</p>
<p>Scanlan did not move, not until the man in the
cell gave the word. Then he obeyed orders to the
letter. His right hand found the bunch of keys,
fitted the correct one to the door, and unlocked it
according to instructions. Not until he was relieved
of his weapon did Blackwell release him. The
jailer was backed into the cell, gagged with a piece
of torn bedding, and left locked up as securely as
the other had been a few minutes earlier.</p>
<p>The convict made his way downstairs, opened the
outer door with the bunch of keys he had taken from
Scanlan, locked it behind him, and slipped into the
first alley that offered refuge. By way of the
Mexican quarters he reached the suburbs and open
country. Two hours later he stole a horse from
an irrigated ranch near town. Within twenty-four
hours he had reached the Soapy Stone horse ranch
and safety.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></p>
<p>After this the plans for the raid on the Texas,
Arizona &amp; Pacific Flyer moved swiftly to a head.
Soapy Stone and Sam dropped into Saguache inconspicuously
one evening. Next day Stone rode
down to Tin Cup to look over the ground. Maloney
telephoned their movements to the Circle C and
to the Hashknife. This brought to Saguache Luck
Cullison, Curly Flandrau, and Slats Davis. Bucky
O&#8217;Connor had been called to Douglas on important
business and could not lend his help.</p>
<p>Curly met Sam in front of Chalkeye&#8217;s Place.
They did the town together in a mild fashion and
Flandrau proposed that they save money by taking
a common room. To this young Cullison agreed.</p>
<p>Luck, Curly and Dick Maloney had already ridden
over the country surrounding the scene of the projected
hold-up. They had decided that the robbery
would probably take place at the depot, so that the
outlaws could get the agent to stop the Flyer without
arousing suspicion. In a pocket of the hills
back of the station a camp had been selected, its
site well back from any trail and so situated that
from it one could command a view of Tin Cup.</p>
<p>The owner of the Circle C selected three of his
closemouthed riders&mdash;Sweeney, Jake and Buck were
the ones he chose&mdash;to hold the camp with him until
after the robbery. The only signal they needed was
the stopping of the Flyer at Tin Cup. Then they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
would come pounding down from the hills in time
to catch the robbers before they had got through
with their work. Maloney or Curly would be on
the train to take a hand in the battle. Caught by
surprise, Soapy&#8217;s gang would surely be trapped.</p>
<p>So they planned it, but it happened that Soapy
Stone had made his arrangements differently.</p>
<p>Luck and his riders took their blankets and their
traps down to Tin Cup according to agreement,
while Davis, Maloney and Flandrau looked after
the Saguache end of the business. All of them
were very friendly with Sam. The boy, younger
than any of them, was flattered that three of the
best known riders in the territory should make so
much of him. Moreover, Stone had given him
instructions to mix with Curly&#8217;s crowd as much as
he could. He had given as a reason that it would
divert suspicion, but what he really wanted was
to throw the blame of the hold-up on these friends
after Sam was found dead on the scene.</p>
<p>Young Cullison had stopped drinking, but he
could not keep his nerves from jumping. His companions
pretended not to notice how worried he
was, but they watched him so closely that he was
never out of the sight of at least one of them.
Soapy had decreed the boy&#8217;s death by treachery,
but his friends were determined to save him and to
end forever the reign of Stone as a bad man.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></p>
<p>It was one day when the four young cowpunchers
were sitting together in Curly&#8217;s room playing poker
that a special delivery letter came to Sam. The
others, to cover their excitement, started an argument
as to whether five aces (they were playing
with the joker) beat a straight flush. Presently
Sam spoke, as indifferently as he could.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got the offer of a job down the line. Think
I&#8217;ll run down to-night far as Casa Grande and see
what&#8217;s doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they need any extra riders here&#8217;s some more
out of a job,&#8221; Dick told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heard to-day of a freighter that wants a mule-skinner.
I&#8217;m going to see him to-morrow,&#8221; Slats
chipped in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Darn this looking for a job anyhow. It&#8217;s tur&#8217;ble
slow work,&#8221; Curly followed up, yawning. &#8220;Well,
here&#8217;s hoping you land yours, Sam.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was about two o&#8217;clock in the afternoon. The
game dragged on for a while, but nobody took any
interest in it. Sam had to get ready for the work
of the night, and the rest were anxious to get out
and give him a chance. So presently Dick threw
down his cards.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had enough poker for one session. Me,
I&#8217;m going to drift out and see what&#8217;s moving in
town.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Think I&#8217;ll snooze for a while,&#8221; Sam said, stretching
sleepily.</p>
<p>The others trooped out and left him alone. From
the room rented by Davis the three watched to see
that Sam did not leave without being observed. He
did not appear, and about six o&#8217;clock Curly went
back to his room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Time to grub,&#8221; he sang out.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; Sam agreed.</p>
<p>They went to the New Orleans Hash House,
and presently Davis and Maloney also arrived. The
party ordered a good dinner and took plenty of
time to eat it. Sam was obviously nervous, but
eager to cover his uneasiness under a show of good
spirits.</p>
<p>Curly finished eating just as Sam&#8217;s second cup
of coffee came. Flandrau, who had purposely
chosen a seat in the corner where he was hemmed
in by the chairs of the others, began to feel in his
vest pockets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Darned if I&#8217;ve got a cigar. Sam, you&#8217;re young
and nimble. Go buy me one at the counter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221; Cullison was away on the instant.</p>
<p>Curly&#8217;s hand came out of his pocket. In it was
a paper. Quickly he shook the contents of the
paper into the steaming cup of coffee and stirred
the liquid with a spoon.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></p>
<p>Sam brought back the cigar and drank his coffee.
Without any unnecessary delay they returned to
his room. Before the party had climbed the stairs
the boy was getting drowsy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno what&#8217;s the matter with me. I&#8217;m feeling
awful sleepy,&#8221; he said, sitting on the bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you take a snooze? You&#8217;ve got lots
of time before the train goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t reckon I better.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rubbed his eyes, yawned, and slumped down.
His lids wavered, shut, jerked open again, and
closed slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wake me, Curly&mdash;time for train.&#8221; And with
that he was sound asleep.</p>
<p>They took off his boots and settled him comfortably.
In his pocket they found a black mask
big enough to cover his whole face. The registered
letter could not be found and they decided he must
have destroyed it.</p>
<p>The sight of the mask had given Curly an idea.
He was of about the same build as Sam. Why
not go in his place? It would be worth doing just
to catch sight of Soapy&#8217;s face when he took the
mask off after the robbers had been captured.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use?&#8221; Davis protested. &#8220;It&#8217;s an unnecessary
risk. They might shoot you in place of
Sam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll look out for myself. Don&#8217;t worry about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
that. Before the time for getting rid of Sam comes
Mr. Soapy and his bunch will be prisoners.&#8221;</p>
<p>They argued it out, but Curly was set and could
not be moved. He dressed in young Cullison&#8217;s
clothes and with Maloney took the express at 9:57.
Davis remained to guard Sam.</p>
<p>Curly&#8217;s watch showed 10:17 when the wheels
began to grind from the setting of the air brakes.
He was in the last sleeper, Dick in the day coach
near the front. They had agreed that Dick was
to drop off as soon as the train slowed down enough
to make it safe, whereas Curly would go on and
play Sam&#8217;s part until the proper time.</p>
<p>The train almost slid to a halt from the pressure
of the hard-jammed brakes. A volley of shots rang
out. Curly slipped the mask over his face and
rose with a revolver in each hand. He had been
sitting at the end of the car, so that nobody noticed
him until his voice rang out with a crisp order.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hands up! Don&#8217;t anybody move!&#8221;</p>
<p>An earthquake shock could not have alarmed the
passengers more. The color was washed completely
from the faces of most of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reach for the roof. Come, punch a hole in the
sky!&#8221; To do it thoroughly, Curly flung a couple
of shots through the ceiling. That was enough.
Hands went up without any argument, most of them
quivering as from an Arkansas chill.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span></p>
<p>Presently Cranston herded the passengers in from
the forward coaches. With them were most of the
train crew. The front door of the car was locked
so that they could not easily get out.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re cutting off the express car and going
forward to &#8217;Dobe Wells with it. There we can
blow open the safe uninterrupted,&#8221; Bad Bill explained.
&#8220;You ride herd on the passengers here
from the outside till you hear two shots, then hump
yourself forward and hop on the express car.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fine! Curly was to stand out there in the moonlight
and let anybody in the car that had the nerve
pepper away at him. If they did not attend to
the job of riddling him, his false friends would do
it while he was running forward to get aboard.
Nothing could have been simpler&mdash;if he had not
happened to have had inside information of their
intent.</p>
<p>He had to think quickly, for the plans of him
and his friends had been deranged. They had
reckoned on the express car being rifled on the spot.
This would have given Cullison time to reach the
scene of action. Mow they would be too late. Maloney,
lying snugly in the bear grass beside the
track, would not be informed as to the arrangement.
Unless Curly could stop it, the hold-up
would go through according to the program of
Soapy and not of his enemies.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></p>
<p>The decision of Flamdrau was instantaneous. He
slid down beside the track into the long grass.
Whipping up one of his guns, he fired. As if
in answer to the first shot his revolver cracked
twice. Simultaneously, he let out a cry of pain,
wriggled back for a dozen yards through the
grass, and crossed the track in the darkness. As
he crouched down close to the wheels of the
sleeper someone came running back on the other
side.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up, Sam? You hit?&#8221; he could hear
Blackwell whisper.</p>
<p>No answer came. The paroled convict was standing
close to the car for fear of being hit himself
and he dared not move forward into the grass to
investigate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sam,&#8221; he called again; then, &#8220;He&#8217;s sure got
his.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was all Curly wanted to know. Softly he
padded forward, keeping as low as he could till he
reached the empty sleepers. A brakeman was just
uncoupling the express car when Curly dived underneath
and nestled close to the trucks.</p>
<p>From where he lay he could almost have reached
out and touched Soapy standing by the car.</p>
<p>&#8220;What about the kid?&#8221; Stone asked Blackwell
as the latter came up.</p>
<p>&#8220;They got him. Didn&#8217;t you hear him yelp?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but did they put him out of business?
See his body?&#8221;</p>
<p>Blackwell had no intention of going back into
the fire zone and making sure. For his part he was
satisfied. So he lied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep. Blew the top of his head off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; Soapy nodded. &#8220;That&#8217;s a receipt in
full for Mr. Luck Cullison.&#8221;</p>
<p>The wheels began to move. Soon they were
hitting only the high spots. Curly guessed they
must be doing close to sixty miles an hour. Down
where he was the dust was flying so thickly he
could scarce breathe, as it usually does on an Arizona
track in the middle of summer.</p>
<p>Before many minutes the engine began to slow
down. The wheels had hardly stopped moving when
Curly crept out, plowed through the sand, up the
rubble of a little hill, and into a draw where a
bunch of scrub oaks offered cover.</p>
<p>A voice from in front called to him. Just then
the moon appeared from behind drifting clouds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s you, Sam. Everything all right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right as the wheat. We&#8217;re blowing open the
safe now,&#8221; Flandrau answered.</p>
<p>Moving closer, he saw that his questioner was
the man in charge of the horses. Though he knew
the voice, he could not put a name to its owner.
But this was not the point that first occupied his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
mind. <i>There were only four horses for five riders.</i>
Curly knew now that he had not been mistaken.
Soapy had expected one of his allies to stay on the
field of battle, had prepared for it from the beginning.
The knowledge of this froze any remorse
the young <i>vaquero</i> might have felt.</p>
<p>He pushed his revolver against the teeth of the
horse wrangler.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t move, you bandy-legged maverick, or I&#8217;ll
fill your hide full of holes. And if you want to
keep on living padlock that mouth of yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>In spite of his surprise the man caught the point
at once. He turned over his weapons without a
word.</p>
<p>Curly unwound a rope from one of the saddles
and dropped a loop round the neck of his prisoner.
The two men mounted and rode out of the draw,
the outlaw leading the other two horses. As soon
as they reached the bluff above Flandrau outlined
the next step in the program.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll stay here in the <i>tornilla</i> and see what
happens, my friend. Unless you&#8217;ve a fancy to get
lead poisoning keep still.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who in Mexico are you?&#8221; the captured man
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your showdown. Skin off that mask.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man hesitated. His own revolver moved a
few inches toward his head. Hastily he took off
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
the mask. The moon shone on the face of the man
called Dutch. Flandrau laughed. Last time they
had met Curly had a rope around his neck. Now
the situation was reversed.</p>
<p>An explosion below told them that the robbers
had blown open the safe. Presently Soapy&#8217;s voice
came faintly to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring up the horses.&#8221;</p>
<p>He called again, and a third time. The dwarfed
figures of the outlaws stood out clear in the moonlight.
One of them ran up the track toward the
draw. He disappeared into the scrub oaks, from
whence his alarmed voice came in a minute.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dutch! Oh, Dutch!&#8221;</p>
<p>The revolver rim pressed a little harder against
the bridge of the horse wrangler&#8217;s nose.</p>
<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t here,&#8221; Blackwell called back to his
accomplices.</p>
<p>That brought Stone on the run. &#8220;You condemned
idiot, he <i>must</i> be there. Ain&#8217;t he had two
hours to get here since he left Tin Cup?&#8221;</p>
<p>They shouted themselves hoarse. They wandered
up and down in a vain search. All the time Curly
and his prisoner sat in the brush and scarcely batted
an eye.</p>
<p>At last Soapy gave up the hunt. The engine
and the express car were sent back to join the rest
of the train and as soon as they were out of sight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
the robbers set out across country toward the Flatiron
ranch.</p>
<p>Curly guessed their intentions. They would rustle
horses there and head for the border. It was the
only chance still left them.</p>
<p>After they had gone Curly and his prisoner returned
to the road and set out toward Tin Cup.
About a mile and a half up the line they met Cullison
and his riders on the way down. Maloney was
with them. He had been picked up at the station.</p>
<p>Dick gave a shout of joy when he heard Flandrau&#8217;s
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you Curly! I&#8217;ve been scared stiff for fear
they&#8217;d got you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luck caught the boy&#8217;s hand and wrung it hard.
&#8220;You plucky young idiot, you&#8217;ve got sand in your
craw. What the deuce did you do it for?&#8221;</p>
<p>They held a conference while the Circle C riders
handcuffed Dutch and tied him to a horse. Soon
the posse was off again, having left the prisoner
in charge of one of the men. They swung round
in a wide half circle, not wishing to startle their
game until the proper time. The horses pounded
up hills, slid into washes, and plowed through sand
on a Spanish trot, sometimes in the moonlight,
more often in darkness. The going was rough,
but they could not afford to slacken speed.</p>
<p>When they reached the edge of the mesa that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
looked down on the Flatiron the moon was out and
the valley was swimming in light. They followed
the dip of a road that led down to the corral. Passing
the fenced lane leading to the stable, they tied
their ponies inside and took the places assigned to
them by Cullison.</p>
<p>They had not long to wait. In less than half an
hour three shadowy figures slipped round the edge
of the corral and up the lane. Each of them carried
a rifle in addition to his hip guns.</p>
<p>They slid into the open end of the stable. Cullison&#8217;s
voice rang out coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drop your guns!&#8221;</p>
<p>A startled oath, a shot, and before one could have
lifted a hand that silent moonlit valley of peace had
become a battlefield.</p>
<p>The outlaws fell back from the stable, weapons
smoking furiously. Blackwell broke into a run,
never looking behind him, but Soapy and Bad Bill
gave back foot by foot fighting every step of the
way.</p>
<p>Dick and Curly rose from behind the rocks where
they had been placed and closed the trap on Blackwell.
The paroled convict let out one yell.</p>
<p>&#8220;I give up. Goddlemighty, don&#8217;t shoot!&#8221;</p>
<p>His rifle he had already thrown away. With his
arms reaching above him, his terror-stricken eyes
popping from his head, he was a picture of the most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
frightened &#8220;bad man&#8221; who had ever done business
in Arizona.</p>
<p>Half way down the lane Cranston was hit. He
sank to his knees, and from there lopped over sideways
to his left elbow. In the darkness his voice
could be heard, for the firing had momentarily
ceased.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got me, Soapy. Run for it. I&#8217;ll hold
&#8217;em back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hit bad, Bill?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all in. <i>Vamos!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Stone turned to run, and for the first time saw
that his retreat was cut off. As fast as he could
pump the lever his rifle began working again.</p>
<p>The firing this time did not last more than five
seconds. When the smoke cleared it was all over.
Soapy lay on his back, shot through and through.
Blackwell had taken advantage of the diversion to
crawl through the strands of barbed wire and to
disappear in the chaparral. Bill had rolled over on
his face.</p>
<p>Curly crept through the fence after the escaping
man, but in that heavy undergrowth he knew it
was like looking for a needle in a haystack. After
a time he gave it up and returned to the field of
battle.</p>
<p>Dick was bending over Stone. He looked up at
the approach of his friend and said just one word.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cullison had torn open Cranston&#8217;s shirt and was
examining his wounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;No use, Luck. I&#8217;ve got a-plenty. You sure
fooled us thorough. Was it Sam gave us away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Bill. Curly overheard Soapy and Blackwell
at Chalkeye&#8217;s Place. Sam stood pat, though you
were planning to murder him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t in on that, Luck&mdash;didn&#8217;t know a thing
about it till after the boy was shot. I wouldn&#8217;t
a-stood for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He wasn&#8217;t shot. Curly saved him. He had to
give you away to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good enough. Serves Soapy right for double
crossing Sam. Take care of that kid, Luck. He&#8217;s
all right yet.&#8221; His eye fell on Flandrau. &#8220;You&#8217;re
a game sport, son. You beat us all. No hard
feelings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry it had to be this way, Bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dying man was already gray to the lips, but
his nerve did not falter. &#8220;It had to come some
time. And it was Luck ought to have done it too.&#8221;
He waved aside Sweeney, who was holding a flask
to his lips. &#8220;What&#8217;s the use? I&#8217;ve got mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we take him to the house?&#8221; Maloney
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;ll die in the open. Say, there&#8217;s something
else, boys. Curly has been accused of that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
Bar Double M horse rustling back in the early summer.
I did that job. He was not one of us. You
hear, boys. Curly was not in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later he died. He had lied
to save from the penitentiary the lad who had
brought about his death. Curly knew why he had
done it&mdash;because he felt himself to blame for the
affair. Maybe Bad Bill had been a desperado, a
miscreant according to the usual standard, but when
it came to dying he knew how to go better than
many a respectable citizen. Curly stole off into the
darkness so that the boys would not see him play
the baby.</p>
<p>By this time the men from the Flatiron were appearing,
armed with such weapons as they could
hastily gather. The situation was explained to
them. Neighboring ranches were called up by telephone
and a systematic hunt started to capture
Blackwell.</p>
<p>Luck left his three riders to help in the man hunt,
but he returned with Curly and Maloney to
Saguache. On the pommel of his saddle was a
sack. It contained the loot from the express car
of the Flyer. Two lives already had been sacrificed
to get it, and the sum total taken amounted only
to one hundred ninety-four dollars and sixteen
cents.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THE PRODIGAL SON</h3>
</div>

<p>They found the prodigal son with his sister and
Laura London at the Del Mar. Repentance was
writ large all over his face and manner. From
Davis and from the girls he had heard the story of
how Soapy Stone had intended to destroy him. His
scheme of life had been broken into pieces and he
was a badly shaken young scamp.</p>
<p>When Luck and Curly came into the room he
jumped up, very white about the lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My boy!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cullison had him by the hand, one arm around
the shaking shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&mdash;&mdash;what&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam&#8217;s question broke down, but his father guessed
it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Soapy and Bad Bill were killed, Dutch is a
prisoner, and Blackwell escaped. All Spring Valley
is out after him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy was aghast. &#8220;My God!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Best thing for all of us. Soapy meant to murder
you. If it hadn&#8217;t been for Curly&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No question about it. He brought no horse for
you to ride away on. Bill admitted it, though he
didn&#8217;t know what was planned. Curly heard Soapy
ask Blackwell whether he had seen your body.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy shuddered and drew a long sobbing,
breath. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been a fool, Father&mdash;and worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forget it, son. We&#8217;ll wipe the slate clean. I&#8217;ve
been to blame too.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was no place for outsiders. Curly beat a retreat
into the next room. The young women followed
him. Both of them were frankly weeping.
Arms twined about each other&#8217;s waists, they disappeared
into an adjoining bedroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go,&#8221; Kate called to him over her shoulder.</p>
<p>Curly sat down and waited. Presently Kate came
back alone. Her shining eyes met his.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never was so happy in all my life before. Tell
me what happened&mdash;everything please.&#8221;</p>
<p>As much as was good for her to know Curly
told. Without saying a word she listened till he
was through. Then she asked a question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t Dutch tell about Sam being in it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t matter if he does. Evidence of an accomplice
not enough to convict. Soapy overshot
himself. I&#8217;m here to testify that Sam and he
quarrelled before Sam left. Besides, Dutch won&#8217;t
talk. I drilled it into him thorough that he&#8217;d better
take his medicine without bringing Sam in.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span></p>
<p>She sat for a long time looking out of the window
without moving. She did not make the least
sound, but the young man knew she was crying
softly to herself. At last she spoke in a low sweet
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;What can we do for you? First you save
Father and then Sam. You risked everything for
my brother&mdash;to win him back to us, to save his
life and now his reputation. If you had been killed
people would always have believed you were one
of the gang.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sho! That&#8217;s nonsense, Miss Kate.&#8221; He
twisted his hat in his hand uneasily. &#8220;Honest, I
enjoyed every bit of it. And a fellow has to pay
his debts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was that why you did it?&#8221; she asked softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I had to make good. I had to show your
father and you that I had not thrown away all your
kindness. So I quit travelling that downhill road
on which I had got started.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad&mdash;I&#8217;m so glad.&#8221; She whispered it so
low he could hardly hear.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was one way to prove myself. That was
to stand between Sam and trouble. So I butted in
and spoiled Soapy&#8217;s game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could tell you how fine Father thinks
it was of you. He doesn&#8217;t speak of it much, but
I know.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing to what I did&mdash;nothing at all.&#8221; A wave
of embarrassment had crept to the roots of his curly
hair. &#8220;Just because a fellow&mdash;Oh, shucks!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all very well for you to say, but you can&#8217;t
help us thinking what we please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that ain&#8217;t right. I don&#8217;t want you thinking
things that ain&#8217;t so because&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes? Because&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>She lifted her eyes and met his. Then she knew
it had to come out, that the feeling banked in him
would overflow in words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you&#8217;re the girl I love.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had not intended to say it now, lest he might
seem to be urging his services as a claim upon her.
But the words had slipped out in spite of him.</p>
<p>She held out her two hands to him with a little
gesture of surrender. The light of love was in her
starry eyes.</p>
<p>And then&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>She was in his arms, and the kisses he had
dreamed about were on his lips.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>CUTTING TRAIL</h3>
</div>

<p>Kate Cullison had disappeared, had gone out riding
one morning and at nightfall had not returned.
As the hours passed, anxiety at the Circle C became
greater.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe she got lost,&#8221; Bob suggested.</p>
<p>Her father scouted this as absurd. &#8220;Lost nothing.
You couldn&#8217;t lose her within forty miles of
the ranch. She knows this country like a cow
does the range. And say she was lost&mdash;all she
would have to do would be to give that pinto his
head and he&#8217;d hit a bee line for home. No, nor
she ain&#8217;t had an accident either, unless it included
the pony too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t reckon a cougar&mdash;&mdash;,&#8221; began
Sweeney, and stopped.</p>
<p>Luck looked at his bandy-legged old rider with
eyes in which little cold devils sparkled. &#8220;A human
cougar, I&#8217;ll bet. This time I&#8217;ll take his hide off
inch by inch while he&#8217;s still living.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You thinking of Fendrick?&#8221; asked Sam.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve said it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sweeney considered, rasping his stubbly chin. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
don&#8217;t reckon Cass would do Miss Kate a meanness.
He&#8217;s a white man, say the worst of him. But it
might be Blackwell. When last seen he was heading
into the hills. If he met her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>A spasm of pain shot across Luck&#8217;s face. &#8220;My
God! That would be awful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By Gum, there he is now, Luck.&#8221; Sweeney&#8217;s
finger pointed to an advancing rider.</p>
<p>Cullison swung as on a pivot in time to see someone
drop into the dip in the road, just beyond the
corral. &#8220;Who&mdash;Blackwell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Cass.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fendrick reappeared presently and turned in at
the lane. Cullison, standing on the porch at the
head of the steps looked like a man who was passing
through the inferno. But he looked too a personified
day of judgment untempered by mercy.
His eyes bored like steel gimlets into those of his
enemy.</p>
<p>The sheepman spoke, looking straight at his foe.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve just heard the news. I was down at Yesler&#8217;s
ranch when you &#8217;phoned asking if they had seen
anything of Miss Cullison. I came up to ask you
one question. When was she seen last?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About ten o&#8217;clock this morning. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw her about noon. She was on Mesa Verde,
headed for Blue Cañon looked like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Close enough to speak to her?&#8221; Sam asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. We passed the time of day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221; Luck cut back into the conversation
with a voice like a file.</p>
<p>&#8220;She went on toward the gulch and I kept on to
the ranch. The last I saw of her she was going
straight on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you haven&#8217;t seen her since?&#8221;</p>
<p>The manner of the questioner startled Fendrick.
&#8220;God, man, you don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m in this, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are you&#8217;d better blow your brains out
before I learn it. And if you&#8217;re trying to lead me
on a false scent&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Luck stopped. Words failed
him, but his iron jaw clamped like a vice.</p>
<p>Fendrick spoke quietly. &#8220;I&#8217;m willing. In the
meantime we&#8217;d better travel over toward Mesa
Verde, so as to be ready to start at daybreak.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cullison&#8217;s gaze had never left him. It observed,
weighed, appraised. &#8220;Good enough. We&#8217;ll start.&#8221;</p>
<p>He left Sweeney to answer the telephone while he
was away. All of his other riders were already
out combing the hills under supervision of Curly.
Luck had waited with Sam only to get some definite
information before starting. Now he had his lead.
Fendrick was either telling the truth or he was lying
with some sinister purpose in view. The cattleman
meant to know which.</p>
<p>Morning breaks early in Arizona. By the time
they had come to the spot where the sheepman said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
he had met Kate gray streaks were already lightening
the sky. The party moved forward slowly toward
the cañon, spreading out so as to cover as
much ground as possible. Before they reached its
mouth the darkness had lifted enough to show the
track of a horse in the sand.</p>
<p>They pushed up the gulch as rapidly as they
could. The ashes of a camp fire halted them a few
minutes later. Scattered about lay the feathers and
dismembered bones of some birds.</p>
<p>Cass stooped and picked up some of the feathers.
&#8220;Quails, I reckon. Miss Cullison had three tied
to her saddle horn when I met her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did she come up here to cook them?&#8221; Sam
asked.</p>
<p>Luck was already off his horse, quartering over
the ground to read what it might tell him.</p>
<p>&#8220;She wasn&#8217;t alone. There was a man with her.
See these tracks.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Fendrick who made the next discovery.
He had followed a draw for a short distance and
climbed to a little mesa above. Presently he called
to Cullison.</p>
<p>Father and son hurried toward him. The sheep-owner
was standing at the edge of a prospect hole
pointing down with his finger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone has been in that pit recently, and he&#8217;s
been there several days.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then how did he get out?&#8221; Sam asked.</p>
<p>Fendrick knelt on the edge of the pit and showed
him where a rope had been dragged so heavily that
it had cut deeply into the clay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone pulled him out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s it mean anyhow? Kate wasn&#8217;t in that
hole, was she?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cass shook his head. &#8220;This is my guess. Someone
was coming along here in the dark and fell in.
Suppose Miss Cullison heard him calling as she
came up the gulch. What would she do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come up and help the fellow out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure she would. And if he was hungry&mdash;as he
likely was&mdash;she would cook her quail for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then? Why didn&#8217;t she come home?&#8221;</p>
<p>Luck turned a gray agonized face on him. &#8220;Boy,
don&#8217;t you see? The man was Blackwell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if you&#8217;ll put yourself in Blackwell&#8217;s place
you&#8217;ll see that he couldn&#8217;t let her go home to tell
where she had seen him,&#8221; Fendrick explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then where is she? What did he do with her?&#8221;</p>
<p>There came a moment&#8217;s heavy silence. The pale
face of the boy turned from the sheepman to his
father. &#8220;You don&#8217;t think that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t,&#8221; Cass answered. &#8220;But let&#8217;s look
this thing squarely in the face. There were three
things he could do with her. First, he might leave
her in the pit. He didn&#8217;t do that because he hadn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
the nerve. She might be found soon and set the
hunters on his track. Or she might die in that hole
and he be captured later with her pinto. I know
him. He always plays a waiting game when he
can. Takes no chances if he can help it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think he took her with him then,&#8221; Luck
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. There&#8217;s a third possibility. He may have
shot her when he got a good chance, but I don&#8217;t
think so. He would keep her for a hostage as long
as he could.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way I figure it,&#8221; agreed Cullison.
&#8220;He daren&#8217;t hurt her, for he would know Arizona
would hunt him down like a wolf if he did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then where&#8217;s he taking her?&#8221; Sam asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somewhere into the hills. He knows every
pocket of them. His idea will be to slip down and
cut across the line into Sonora. He&#8217;s a rotten bad
lot, but he won&#8217;t do her any harm unless he&#8217;s pushed
to the wall. The fear of Luck Cullison is in his
heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about it,&#8221; nodded Luck. &#8220;He&#8217;s somewhere
in these hills unless he&#8217;s broken through.
Bolt &#8217;phoned me that one of his posse came on the
ashes of a camp fire still warm. They&#8217;re closing in
on him. He&#8217;s got to get food or starve, unless he
can break through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a chance he&#8217;ll make for one of my sheep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
camps to lay in a supply. Wouldn&#8217;t it be a good
idea to keep a man stationed at each one of them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re talking sense,&#8221; Cullison approved. &#8220;Sam,
ride back and get in touch with Curly. Tell him
to do that. And rouse the whole country over the
wire. We&#8217;ll run him down and feed him to the
coyotes.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>A GOOD SAMARITAN</h3>
</div>

<p>Fendrick had told the exact truth. After leaving
him Kate had ridden forward to the cañon and entered
it. She did not mean to go much farther,
but she took her time. More than once she slipped
from under a fold of her waist a letter and reread
sentences of it. Whenever she did this her eyes
smiled. For it was a love letter from Curly, the
first she had ever had. It had been lying on the
inner edge of the threshold of her bedroom door
that morning when she got up, and she knew that
her lover had risen early to put it there unnoticed.</p>
<p>They were to be married soon. Curly had wished
to wait till after his trial, but she had overruled him.
Both her father and Sam had sided with her, for
she had made them both see what an advantage
it would be with a jury for Flandrau to have his
bride sitting beside him in the courtroom.</p>
<p>Faintly there came to her a wind-swept sound.
She pulled up and waited, but no repetition of it
reached her ears. But before her pony had moved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
a dozen steps she stopped him again. This time
she was almost sure of a far cry, and after it the
bark of a revolver.</p>
<p>With the touch of a rein she guided her horse
toward the sound. It might mean nothing. On
the other hand it might be a call for help. Her
shout brought an answer which guided her to the
edge of a prospect hole. In the darkness she made
out an indistinct figure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Water,&#8221; a husky voice demanded.</p>
<p>She got her canteen from the saddle and dropped
it to him. The man glued his lips to the mouth as
if he could never get enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake get me out of here,&#8221; he pleaded
piteously.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long have you been there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two days. I fell in at night whilst I was cutting
acrost country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kate fastened her rope to the horn of the saddle,
tightened the cinch carefully, and dropped the other
end to him. She swung to the back of the horse
and braced herself by resting her full weight on the
farther stirrup.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she told him.</p>
<p>The imprisoned man tried to pull himself up,
bracing his feet against the rough projections of
the rock wall to help him. But he could not manage
the climb. At last he gave it up with an oath.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try another way,&#8221; the girl told him cheerfully.</p>
<p>At spaces about a foot distant she tied knots in
the rope for about the first six feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;This time you&#8217;ll make it,&#8221; she promised. &#8220;You
can get up part way as you did before. Then I&#8217;ll
start my horse forward. Keep braced out from
the wall so as not to get crushed.&#8221;</p>
<p>He growled an assent. Once more she got into
the saddle and gave the word. He dragged himself
up a few feet and then the cowpony moved forward.
The legs of the man doubled up under the
strain and he was crushed against the wall just as
he reached the top. However, he managed to hang
on and was dragged over the edge with one cheek
scratched and bleeding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Might a-known you&#8217;d hurt me if you moved so
fast,&#8221; he complained, nursing his wounded face in
such a way as to hide it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I did my best to go carefully,&#8221; the
girl answered, stepping forward.</p>
<p>His hand shot forward and caught her wrist Her
startled eyes flashed to his face. The man was the
convict Blackwell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got anything to eat with you. I&#8217;m starving,&#8221;
he snapped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I shot some quail Let go my hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed evilly, without mirth. &#8220;Don&#8217;t try
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
any of your sassy ways on me. By God, I&#8217;m a
wolf on the howl.&#8221;</p>
<p>In spite of her supple slenderness there was
strength in her small wrists. She fought and
twisted till she was worn out in her efforts to free
herself. Panting, she faced him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me go, I tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>For answer his open hand struck her mouth.
&#8220;Not till you learn your boss. Before I&#8217;m through
with you a squaw won&#8217;t be half so tame as you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He dragged her to the horse, took from its case
the rifle that hung by the saddle, and flung her
from him roughly. Then he pulled himself to the
saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;March ahead of me,&#8221; he ordered.</p>
<p>As soon as they had reached the bed of the cañon
lie called a halt and bade her light a fire and cook
him the quail. She gathered ironwood and catclaw
while he watched her vigilantly. Together they
roasted the birds by holding them over the fire with
sharpened sticks thrust through the wings. He
devoured them with the voracity of a wild beast.</p>
<p>Hitherto his mind had been busy with the immediate
present, but now his furtive shifting gaze
rested on her more thoughtfully. It was as a factor
of his safety that he considered her. Gratitude was
a feeling not within his scope. The man&#8217;s mind
worked just as Fendrick had surmised. He would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
not let her go back to the ranch with the news that
he was hidden in the hills so close at hand. He
dared not leave her in the prospect hole. He was
not yet ready to do murder for fear of punishment.
That was a possibility to be considered only
if he should be hard pressed. The only alternative
left him was to take her to the border as a companion
of his fugitive doublings.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be going now,&#8221; he announced, after he
had eaten.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going where? Don&#8217;t you see I&#8217;ll be a drag to
you? Take my horse and go. You&#8217;ll get along
faster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>She opened her lips to answer, but there was
something in his face&mdash;something at once so cruel
and deadly and wolfish&mdash;that made the words die
on her lips. For the first time it came to her that
if he did not take her with him he would kill her
to insure his own safety. None of the arguments
that would have availed with another man were of
any weight here. Her sex, her youth, the service
she had done him&mdash;these would not count a straw.
He was lost to all the instincts of honor that govern
even hard desperate men of his class.</p>
<p>They struck into the mountains, following a
cattle trail that wound upward with devious twists.
The man rode, and the girl walked in front with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
the elastic lightness, the unconscious flexuous grace
of poise given her body by an outdoor life. After
a time they left the gulch. Steadily they traveled,
up dark arroyos bristling with mesquite, across little
valleys leading into timbered stretches through
which broken limbs and uprooted trees made progress
almost impossible, following always untrodden
ways that appalled with their lonely desolation.</p>
<p>By dusk they were up in the headwaters of the
creeks. The resilient muscles of the girl had lost
their spring. She moved wearily, her feet dragging
heavily so that sometimes she staggered when the
ground was rough. Not once had the man offered
her the horse. He meant to be fresh, ready for
any emergency that might come. Moreover, it
pleased his small soul to see the daughter of Luck
Cullison fagged and exhausted but still answering
the spur of his urge.</p>
<p>The moon was up before they came upon a tent
shining in the cold silvery light. Beside it was a
sheetiron stove, a box, the ashes of a camp fire,
and a side of bacon hanging from the limb of a
stunted pine. Cautiously they stole forward.</p>
<p>The camp was for the time deserted. No doubt
its owner, a Mexican sheepherder in the employ of
Fendrick and Dominguez, was out somewhere with
his flock.</p>
<p>Kate cooked a meal and the convict ate. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
girl was too tired and anxious to care for food,
but she made herself take a little. They packed
the saddlebags with bacon, beans, coffee and flour.
Blackwell tightened again the cinches and once more
the two took the trail.</p>
<p>They made camp in a pocket opening from a
gulch far up in the hills. With her own <i>reata</i> he
fastened her hands behind her and tied the girl
securely to the twisted trunk of a Joshua tree. To
make sure of her he lay on the rope, both hands
clinched to the rifle. In five minutes he was asleep,
but it was long before Kate could escape from
wakefulness. She was anxious, her nerves were
jumpy, and the muscles of arms and shoulders were
cramped. At last she fell into troubled catnaps.</p>
<p>From one of these she awoke to see that the
morning light was sifting through the darkness.
Her bones and muscles ached from the constraint
of the position in which the rope held them. She
was shivering with the chill of an Arizona mountain
night. Turning her body, the girl&#8217;s eyes fell upon
her captor. He was looking at her in the way that
no decent man looks at a woman. Her impulse was
to scream, to struggle to her feet and run. What
did he mean? What was he going to do?</p>
<p>But something warned her this would precipitate
the danger. She called upon her courage and tried
to still the fearful tumult in her heart. Somehow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
she succeeded. A scornful, confident pride flashed
from her eyes into his. It told him that for his
life he dared not lay a finger upon her in the way
of harm. And he knew it was true, knew that if
he gave way to his desire no hole under heaven
would be deep enough to hide him from the vengeance
of her friends.</p>
<p>He got sullenly to his feet. &#8220;Come. We&#8217;ll be
going.&#8221;</p>
<p>Within the hour they saw some of his hunters.
The two were sweeping around the lip of a mountain
park nestling among the summits. A wisp of
smoke rose from the basin below. Grouped about
it were three men eating breakfast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make a sound,&#8221; warned Blackwell.</p>
<p>His rifle covered her. With all her soul she
longed to cry for help. But she dared not take the
risk. Even as the two on the edge of the bowl
withdrew from sight one of the campers rose and
sauntered to a little grove where the ponies were
tethered. The distance was too far to make sure,
but something in the gait made the girl sure that
the man was Curly. Her hands went out to him in
a piteous little gesture of appeal.</p>
<p>She was right. It was Curly. He was thinking
of her at that moment despairingly, but no bell of
warning rang within to tell him she was so near
and in such fearful need of him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span></p>
<p>Twice during the morning did the refugee attempt
to slip down into the parched desert that
stretched toward Sonora and safety. But the cordon
set about him was drawn too close. Each time
a loose-seated rider lounging in the saddle with a
rifle in his hands drove them back. The second attempt
was almost disastrous, for the convict was
seen. The hum of a bullet whistled past his ears
as he and his prisoner drew back into the chaparral
and from thence won back to cover.</p>
<p>Kate, drooping with fatigue, saw that fear rode
Blackwell heavily. He was trapped and he knew
that by the Arizona code his life was forfeit and
would be exacted of him should he be taken. He
had not the hardihood to game it out in silence,
but whined complaints, promises and threats. He
tried to curry favor with her, to work upon her
pity, even while his furtive glances told her that
he was wondering whether he would have a better
chance if he sacrificed her life.</p>
<p>From gulch to arroyo, from rock-cover to pine-clad
hillside he was driven in his attempts to break
the narrowing circle of grim hunters that hemmed
him. And with each failure, with every passing
hour, the terror in him mounted. He would have
welcomed life imprisonment, would have sold the
last vestige of manhood to save the worthless life
that would soon be snuffed out unless he could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
evade his hunters till night and in the darkness
break through the line.</p>
<p>He knew now that it had been a fatal mistake to
bring the girl with him. He might have evaded
Bolt&#8217;s posses, but now every man within fifty miles
was on the lookout for him. His rage turned
against Kate because of it. Yet even in those black
outbursts he felt that he must cling to her as his
only hope of saving himself. He had made another
mistake in lighting a campfire during the
morning. Any fool ought to have known that
the smoke would draw his hunters as the smell of
carrion does a buzzard.</p>
<p>Now he made a third error. Doubling back
over an open stretch of hillside, he was seen again
and forced into the first pocket that opened. It
proved to be a blind gulch, one offering no exit at
the upper end but a stiff rock climb to a bluff above.</p>
<p>He whipped off his coat and gave it to Kate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put it on. Quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Surprised, she slipped it on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now ride back out and cut along the edge of
the hill. You&#8217;ve got time to make it all right before
they close in if you travel fast. Stop once&mdash;just
once&mdash;and I&#8217;ll drop you in your tracks. Now
git!&#8221;</p>
<p>She saw his object in a flash. Wearing his gray
felt hat and his coat, the pursuers would mistake
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
her for him. They would follow her&mdash;perhaps
shoot her down. Anyhow, it would be a diversion
to draw them from him. Meanwhile he would climb
the cliff and slip away unnoticed.</p>
<p>The danger of what she had to do stood out
quite clearly, but as a chance to get away from
him she welcomed it gladly. She swung the pony
with a touch of the rein and set him instantly at
the canter. It was rough going, but she took it
almost blindly.</p>
<p>From the lip of the gulch she swung abruptly
to the right. Her horse stumbled and went down
just as a bullet flew over her head. Before she
was free of the stirrups strong hands pinned her
shoulders to the ground. She heard a glad startled
cry. The rough hands became immediately gentle.
Then things grew black. The last she remembered
was that the mountains were dancing up and down
in an odd fashion.</p>
<p>Her eyes opened to see Curly. She was in his
arms and his face was broken with emotions of
love and tenderness.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not hurt,&#8221; he implored.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t&mdash;mistreat you?&#8221; His voice was
trembling as he whispered it.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>And at that she broke down. A deep sob shook
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
her body&mdash;and another. She buried her head on
his shoulder and wept.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Without losing an instant the convict set himself
at the climb. His haste, the swift glances shot
behind him, the appalling dread that made his nerves
ragged, delayed his speed by dissipating the singleness
of his energy. His face and hands were torn
with catclaw, his knee bruised by a slip against a
sharp jut of quartz.</p>
<p>When he reached the top he was panting and
shaken. Before he had moved a dozen steps a man
came out of the brush scarce seventy-five yards away
and called to him to surrender. He flung his rifle
to place and fired twice.</p>
<p>The man staggered and steadied himself. A
shell had jammed and Blackwell could not throw it
out. He turned to run as the other fired. But he
was too late. He stumbled, tripped, and went down
full length.</p>
<p>The man that had shot him waited for him to
rise. The convict did not move. Cautiously the
wounded hunter came forward, his eyes never lifting
from the inert sprawling figure. Even now he
half expected him to spring up, life and energy in
every tense muscle. Not till he stood over him,
till he saw the carelessly flung limbs, the uncouth
twist to the neck, could he believe that so slight a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
crook of the finger had sent swift death across the
plateau.</p>
<p>The wounded man felt suddenly sick. Leaning
against a rock, he steadied himself till the nausea
was past. Voices called to him from the plain below.
He answered, and presently circled down into
the gulch which led to the open.</p>
<p>At the gulch mouth he came on a little group of
people. One glance told him all he needed to know.
Kate Cullison was crying in the arms of Curly
Flandrau. Simultaneously a man galloped up, flung
himself from his horse, and took the young woman
from her lover.</p>
<p>&#8220;My little girl,&#8221; he cried in a voice that rang
with love.</p>
<p>Luck had found his ewe lamb that was lost.</p>
<p>It was Curly who first saw the man approaching
from the gulch. &#8220;Hello, Cass! Did you get him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Fendrick nodded wearily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead sure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep. He&#8217;s up there.&#8221; The sheepman&#8217;s hand
swept toward the bluff.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wounded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got me in the shoulder. Nothing serious, I
judge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cullison swung around. &#8220;Sure about that, Cass?&#8221;
It was the first time for years that he had called
the other by his first name except in irony.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have a look at the shoulder.&#8221;</p>
<p>After he had done what he could for it Luck
spoke bluffly. &#8220;This dashed feud is off, Cass.
You&#8217;ve wiped the slate clean. When you killed
Blackwell you put me out of a hostile camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad&mdash;so glad. Now we&#8217;ll all be friends,
won&#8217;t we?&#8221; Kate cried.</p>
<p>Cass looked at her and at Curly, both of them
radiant with happiness, and his heart ached for
what he had missed. But he smiled none the less.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suits me if it does you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave one hand to Luck and the other to his
daughter.</p>
<p>Curly laughed gaily. &#8220;Everybody satisfied, I
reckon,&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>LOOSE THREADS</h3>
</div>

<p>Curly was right when he said that those who
knew about Sam&#8217;s share in the planning of the Tin
Cup hold-up would keep their mouths closed. All
of the men implicated in the robbery were dead
except Dutch. Cullison used his influence to get
the man a light sentence, for he knew that he was
not a criminal at heart. In return Dutch went
down the line without so much as breathing Sam&#8217;s
name.</p>
<p>Luck saw to it that Curly got all the credit of
frustrating the outlaws in their attempt on the Flyer
and of capturing them afterward. In the story of
the rescue of Kate he played up Flandrau&#8217;s part
in the pursuit at the expense of the other riders.
For September was at hand and the young man
needed all the prestige he could get. The district
attorney had no choice but to go on with the case
of the State versus Flandrau on a charge of rustling
horses from the Bar Double M. But public sentiment
was almost a unit in favor of the defendant.</p>
<p>The evidence of the prosecution was not so
strong as it had been. All of his accomplices were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
dead and one of the men implicated had given it
out in his last moments that the young man was
not a party to the crime. The man who had owned
the feed corral had sold out and gone to Colorado.
The hotel clerk would not swear positively that
the prisoner was the man he had seen with the other
rustlers.</p>
<p>Curly had one important asset no jury could
forget. It counted for a good deal that Alec Flandrau,
Billy Mackenzie, and Luck Cullison were
known to be backing him, but it was worth much
more that his wife of a week sat beside him in the
courtroom. Every time they looked at the prisoner
the jurymen saw too her dusky gallant little head
and slender figure. They remembered the terrible
experience through which she had so recently
passed. She had come through it to happiness.
Every look and motion of the girl wife radiated
love for the young scamp who had won her. And
since they were tender-hearted old frontiersmen
they did not intend to spoil her joy. Moreover,
society could afford to take chances with this young
fellow Flandrau. He had been wild no doubt, but
he had shown since the real stuff that was in him.
Long before they left the box each member of the
jury knew that he was going to vote for acquittal.</p>
<p>It took the jury only one ballot to find a verdict
of not guilty. The judge did not attempt to stop
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
the uproar of glad cheers that shook the building
when the decision was read. He knew it was not
the prisoner so much they were cheering as the
brave girl who had sat so pluckily for three days
beside the husband she had made a man.</p>
<p>From the courtroom Curly walked out under the
blue sky of Arizona a free man. But he knew that
the best of his good fortune was that he did not
go alone. For all the rest of their lives her firm
little steps would move beside him to keep him true
and steady. He could not go wrong now, for he
was anchored to a responsibility that was a continual
joy and wonder to him.</p>
